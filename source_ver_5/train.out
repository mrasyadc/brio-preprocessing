eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). the copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. the larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae.

echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere, and is most commonly found in adults. in some areas there is a shift from a sylvatic to a synantropic cycle, including domestic dogs, as was seen in china and alaska. such a shift leads to a higher risk of infection in humans. the prevalence in dogs and cats is still very low in europe, even in areas highly endemic for infection in foxes.

sinv has been isolated from africa, eurasia, and australia. the highest disease burden is in northern europe (approximately between 60 and 64 n) and south africa. evolutionary studies show that sinv likely originated from south america, with subsequent spread to north america, asia, and australia, with later spread to europe and africa. highest attack rates in finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in finland, with the last epidemic in 2002.
