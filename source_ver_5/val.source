rvfv primarily causes disease in animals in africa and middle east, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. humans that regularly work with animals (farmers, herders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers) are at increased risk of infection. epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams. rvf was initially confined to sub-saharan africa, but appeared in egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the arabian peninsula (saudi arabia and yemen) in 2000 and later also on the comoros islands. as rvfv epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall, outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented.
vector control; personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places); use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars and dog vaccination; there is no vaccine for human use.
vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; residual spraying of insecticides; treatment of infected humans. recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort. morocco, united arab emirates, and turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by who.
o. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. o. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.

symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder: fever, headache, myalgia, backache, lymphadenopathy (not seen in smallpox), malaise, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body; the lesions eventually crust and fall off. the outcome can be fatal (cfr: 1–10%).
microscopy of stool specimens cannot distinguish between e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii, and e. dispar; pcr is able to distinguish between these species; stool antigen tests can identify e. histolytica. 
supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin g, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
serology: igm capture elisa on serum or csf; antibodies can be detected in csf after 4 days of disease onset, and in serum after 7 days. virus isolation or viral rna detection by rt-pcr are insensitive.
most infections are asymptomatic or mild. symptoms are: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss, rarely anemia. massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis. proglottids can be seen in the stool.
infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound. the tabanid bite is painful with blood loss.
snails, slugs, and land planarians. the giant african snail, achatina fulica, is the major source of infection world wide; but has been replaced by the imported south american golden apple snail, pomacea canaliculata, in taiwan and mainland china.
wnv was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the west nile district of uganda in 1937. molecular studies suggest that wnv emerged in africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. until the introduction of wnv in new york in 1999, wnv infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. since the introduction to northeast america, the virus has spread to most regions in north america, canada, mexico, the caribbean and several cases in south america. the national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the usa during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). in that time period in the usa, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. the highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin thewest central and mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic wnv vector in those areas. most us cases occur in the late summer, when culex mosquitoes are more active and after wnv amplification in the bird reservoir. in warm climates year-round transmission is seen.

igm elisa, rt-pcr, virus isolation from blood, urine, or throat washing, seroconversion to igg positive.
zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the old world and is absent from the americas (a single case in the usa was imported from yap island). the competence of mosquitoes on the american continent for zika virus is unknown. the geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases, mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys. positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive, because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses. in 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73% of the population of yap island. there were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak. due to intense air travel in the pacific region and presence of competent vectors, there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond. adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years. approximately 18% of individuals infected by the zika virus develop symptoms; this is similar to that reported for west nile virus infection.
humans
several serologic tests are available. virus can be isolated or rna detected in acute blood by rt-pcr.
deer and dogs (e. chaffeensis, e. ewingii). the whitetailed deer is a complete host for maintaining the transmission cycle of e. chaffeensis. deer, ruminants, and field rodents (a. phagocytophilum); unknown for n. sennetsu; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
lice infestation (pediculosis) can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling (bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation). the body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding. oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people.
standard anti-mosquito precautions.
clinical presentation depends on level of immune suppression. p. marneffei is most often an opportunistic infection in hiv patients with low cd4 counts (<100 cells/m l). most present with fever and typical skin lesions. other findings are anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. respiratory signs can also be observed. skin lesions are often papules with central necrosis on the face and neck, but other body sites can also have lesions. other opportunistic infections also need to be excluded in these patients.

the most common clinical presentation for streptobacillosis is a triad of (1) relapsing fever, (2) severe, migratory polyarthralgias, and (3) a peripheral, hemorrhagic maculopapular rash. the most prominent symptom is severe myalgia with prostration. polyarthralgias occur in two-thirds of reported cases. in spirillosis, the bite site becomes indurated and may ulcerate with regional lymphadenopathy; arthritic symptoms are rare. if untreated, the disease may progress to bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis, parotitis, tenosynovitis, and focal abscesses of soft tissues or the brain. cfr in untreated cases may be as much as 13%. there is a significant risk of streptobacillary endocarditis with associated cfr of 50%.
characterized by high fever of 2–7 days alternating with afebrile periods of 4–14 days, relapsing up to 13 times. initial symptoms include generalized body aches, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, chills, sweats, and a transitory rash. later symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dry cough, photophobia, neck pain, conjunctivitis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, confusion; rarely hematuria and epistaxis. long-term sequelae of tbrf include cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities, ophthalmia and abortion. lbrf is generally more severe than tbrf, but associated with fewer relapses.

trematode worms schistosoma japonicum, s. malayensis, and s. mekongi.
during bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. the amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. in the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. unlike bats, birds are not infected by h. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
parasite, kinetoplastida. leishmania donovani and its subspecies donovani and infantum. l. chagasi is considered to be the same species asl.infantum, and are referred to asl.infantum/ chagasi. occasionally, other leishmania spp. can cause visceral disease, usually in immunocompromised individuals.

cave disease, ohio valley disease, reticuloendotheliosis, african histoplasmosis.
human-deer-fly-human. after infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. in the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. an infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.

the true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern brazil and north iran. this is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. in southeast asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. in northeast thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. sporadic human infections with glanders (b. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.

mainly skin contact with fecally contaminated soil, but oral transmission cannot be excluded.
globally, there exist four patterns of hav infection, based on age-specific hav seroprevalence rates. high-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children, who are usually asymptomatic. adults are immune and epidemics in these high-endemic areas are uncommon. high-endemic areas is defined as a region where > 90% of the children <10 years are already infected and most cases are asymptomatic. the high endemic areas are generally in poor regions with poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water (see human development index map and sanitation map). improving living conditions leads to intermediate endemicity, which causes high disease rates because more infections now occur in older people (as disease averted in children), who are symptomatic. hav epidemiology in high-endemic areas is shifting to intermediate endemicity, which results in an increase in disease burden. large variations exist within countries in hav incidence. in (very) low-endemic areas, children will not acquire the disease and the adult population will remain susceptible, leading to localized outbreaks. in areas of low endemicity, the overall prevalence is <25%. in developed countries with low endemicity, outbreaks are often caused by contaminated food products, like shellfish, which can concentrate virus, and other food products that are contaminated by an infected food handler.
rodents, principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels: marmots, susliks, and prairie dogs. rabbits, camels, carnivores, and domestic cats may also be infected. cats can also develop pneumonic plague. the desert regions of central asia contain endemic plague foci where the great gerbil is the main host.
enzyme immunoassay to detect anti hiv antibodies with confirmation by western blot. fourthgeneration hiv serology tests that consist of antibody detection and p24 antigen detection in combination are now commonly used. also rapid tests are available for field testing. viral load and hiv-1 p24 antigen may be used in some circumstances. cd4 cell counts and hiv viral load are used to monitor progression of infection. genotypic and phenotypic tests are used for hivdrug-resistance testing.

hcv infection has a worldwide prevalence of 2% and an estimated 130 to 170 million chronic cases globally. the highest prevalences are found in africa and asia. egypt has the highest hcv prevalence rate (22%), likely due to a national schistosomiasis treatment campaign since the 1960s that re-used needles. in developing countries the high prevalence is likely due to poor infection control practices in the healthcare system (therapeutic injections, blood transfusion, surgery). also local practices in the community, like acupuncture and cutting of the skin with unsterile knives, are other important routes of transmission. in asia it is common to receive injections for various illnesses outside the hospital setting. in developed countries hcv is mainly transmitted by ivdu, accounting for 70–80% of hcv infections.
hfrs is caused by myodes-, rattus-, and apodemusborne hantaviruses. each virus has its particular host: apodemus spp. (striped field mouse) for htnv, dobv and saav and myodes ( clethrionomys) for puuv. seov infects rattus norvegicus and can therefore be found world wide.

the disease is limited geographically to the range of the vector tick. hyalomma spp. do not occur in the americas and oceania. historically the tick does not appear above 50 n latitude, but possibly due to changes in climate and environment the tick and cchfv outbreaks have occurred above this latitude. in the northern hemisphere, h. marginatum becomes more active by increasing temperatures during spring (april–may) and immature stages are active from may to september. the potential roles of migratory birds and the movement of livestock carrying ticks in the spread of the virus are unclear. cchfv outbreaks mainly occur in those working in agricultural areas. about 90% of the cases in a recent outbreak in turkey were farmers. cases regularly had skin contact with livestock or other animals. also outdoor activities (hiking, camping) in endemic areas are a risk factor. countries on the map marked as having no data (western sahara, palestine, parts of the arabian peninsula, kashmir) are within the range of the vector tick and likely at risk for cchfv outbreaks. cchfv genotypes cluster geographically, with exceptions: the asia 1 genotype has been found in madagascar, where it was possibly introduced by migrating birds, and africa 1 in the middle east, which may have been introduced with infected livestock.
mainly humans; yaws is also found in non-human primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas).
the global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus, and occurs basically between the 10 c isotherms. autochthonous dengue fever cases appeared in europe for the first time in 2010, north of 10 c isotherm and likely transmitted by ae. albopictus (see aedes agypti and aedes albopictus map). there is strong seasonality, correlated with the rainy season, which produces a marked increase in vectors because more mosquito-breeding sites become available then. two, 3 or all 4 serotypes may occur concurrently. dhf/dss in many countries is most often seen in children suffering a secondary infection with a different serotype. incidence rates of up to 3% have been seen in dengue naõve populations such as are found in some pacific islands.
there is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito. the mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites, which, after release, infect erythrocytes. the erythrocytic stages multiply around 10-fold every 48-hours. erythrocytes can release gametocytes which infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. in the mosquito, gametocytes develop into sporozoites.

hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (l3) that can penetrate the skin. after entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. in the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). after mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. the cfr is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
