rvfv primarily causes disease in animals in africa and middle east, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. rvf was initially confined to sub-saharan africa, but appeared in egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the arabian peninsula (saudi arabia and yemen) in 2000 and later also on the comoros islands.

wnv was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the west nile district of uganda in 1937. molecular studies suggest that wnv emerged in africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. until the introduction of wnv in new york in 1999, wnv infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. since the introduction to northeast america, the virus has spread to most regions in north america, canada, mexico, the caribbean and several cases in south america.
