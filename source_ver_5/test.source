leptospira chronically colonize the proximal renal tubules of many animals and are excreted in the urine into the environment. animals can shed leptospira into the environment for prolonged periods without any signs of disease.
for c. philippinensis: eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds; after ingestion by freshwater fish, larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues. ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host. the adults of c. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine, where the females lay eggs. released larvae can cause autoinfection, which may progress to hyperinfection.
not completely understood: moist environments close to waterways, in forest or under flooring, also sandy and acidic soil and rotten vegetation. bird excreta have also been implicated as a potential reservoir. dogs are more commonly infected than humans but do not transmit disease.
tb is a major cause of death and disability world wide, especially in developing countries. morbidity and mortality rates increase with age, and are higher in males. in regions of high incidence, morbidity peaks in adults of working age. morbidity is higher in urban populations, among the poor, and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks. there were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of tb in the world in 2007 (14% hiv positive), an almost 50% increase from 1990, and an estimated onethird of the world’s population is either latently or actively infected with tb. most of the cases in 2007 were in asia (55%) and africa (31%). mdr-tb is a serious problem in russia, former russian republics, india and china. in 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million mdr-tb cases. by 2008, 55 countries reported at least one xdr-tb case.
sudden onset of fever lasting 2–7 days, sometimes biphasic, severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and a maculopapular rash (not easily seen on dark skin). most cases recover. minor occurrence of petechiae, epistaxis, or gingival bleeding may be seen. serious hemorrhagic manifestations, like a severe drop in blood platelets, indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf), that can progress to dengue shock syndrome (dss) and death. infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity, but little cross-immunity to other serotypes. cross-immunity may exacerbate, rather than diminish, disease severity when infected with a new serotype; dhf leading to dss can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype, but dhf/dss has also been reported in primary infections. cfr for dhf is up to 20%, for untreated dss up to 50%, and 1–2% if correctly treated.
the 17d live, attenuated vaccine is protective after 10 days; revaccination is recommended every 10 years. anti-mosquito precautions. prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle.
humans.
the cestode diphyllobothrium latum (fish or broad tapeworm), the largest human tapeworm (up to 25 meters long). in japan and eastern russia d. nihonkaiense is common. at least 13 other diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently.
microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. in humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
the highest global burden of cl is in the old world. in the americas, bolivia, brazil, and peru have the highest burden of cl. in the new world, cl mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the old world it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. transmision can also occur in deforested areas. disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
who (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in india and sub saharan africa. 90% of the infections are due to w. bancrofti. chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. about 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). asia and south america have lower bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than sub saharan africa (up to 37%) and pacific island (up to 48%) regions. within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. reciffe, brazil). in the americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. china has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. the vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
in the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during world war ii. childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to who have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. the who has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. however, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former soviet union. since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in africa, the middle east, asia, and south america. without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of c. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. this has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
mosquitoes (aedes and culex spp.).
infective sporozoites are inoculated by the bite of anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites, or to a dormant stage (hypnozoite) that can become active after months or years, causing relapse. merozoites released from liver infect erythrocytes that develop to schizonts, rupture and release merozoites that will infect new erythrocytes (this cycle takes 48 hours). some merozoites develop into gametocytes that are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal.

who estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. the disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. the disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. it is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. african trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. however, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. the chronic gambiense form in west and central africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the great rift valley. uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.
lfv was isolated from a missionary nurse living in lassa, nigeria, in 1969. it is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic lassa fever cases in west africa each year, with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000. lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions: the mano river region (guinea, sierra leone, liberia) in the west, and nigeria in the east. in the dry season, the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses, and in the rainy season, the rat forages in the surrounding fields. villages with lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah, where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm. lfv can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season. however, in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses.

chikungunya means ‘that which bends up’ in makonde language, to describe the pain.
tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas, and in warm and wet regions. in the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, mostly in newborn infants. the current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults. in countries with good vaccine coverage in children, adult cases may still be common, as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus. the dtp3 vaccination coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood. the elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79% (153/193) of who member states. however, since c. tetani will always remain present in nature, tetanus will always remain a threat, and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely.
rarely reported in the americas and europe, sporadic in parts of southeast asia, especially thailand, china, and vietnam. most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. furthermore, in several asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. since s. suis is often misidentified, s. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.

personal anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine for wee.
immunocompromised, asplenic, and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. the number of cases diagnosed in the usa has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population, hosts of the adult vector ticks. nearly all patients with babesia divergens infection in europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. the b. divergens-like parasite in the usa has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits, and is not infectious for cattle; it has been found in only 3 patients. all 3 patients with b. venatorum (eu1) infection had also been splenectomized. cape verdean, egyptian, and asian cases lie outside the range of ixodes ricinus; b. duncani and b. divergens-like cases in west coast states of usa lie outside the range of i. scapularis. possible vectors for these cases are i. dentatus in the central usa, and i. pacificus on the west coast. infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.
epidemic hepatitis, infectious hepatitis, infectious jaundice, catarrhal jaundice.
during bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. the amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. in the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.

uruma fever.
the most prevalent htlv-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with atl (immunosuppression) or associated with ham/tsp (immunoactivation). the htlv-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and atl. the htlv-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop htlv-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, sjogren syndrome and ham/tsp.
bartonella quintana (formerly rochalimaea quintana and rickettsia quintana), a fastidious intracellular gram-negative bacterium.
before 2004, chikv was considered a minor arboviral disease, but since then has spread globally, infecting millions of people. most cases are symptomatic. chikv has been endemic in africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. chikv spread to asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks, similar to dengue fever, involving ae. egypti. the global epidemic started since a mutation in the chikv e1 glycoprotein gene (a226v) occurred, that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by ae. albopictus. the mutated chikv is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where ae. albopictus is present. in 2005–2006 chikv spread from east africa to virgin soil in the indian ocean islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. since 2006, chikv outbreaks with are reported from several (sub)tropical countries in the new world. chikv virus was imported into several european countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern italy. chikv-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous chikv-free areas if ae. albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present.
wear impermeable gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs; cook wild game well; avoid drinking water from untreated sources; wear long-sleeved clothes and use repellent to protect against arthropod bites.
monkeypox virus (mpv), a double-stranded dna virus of the genus orthopoxvirus, family poxviridae. two clades of monkeypox viruses are known: the west african virus and the congo basin virus. the congo basin strain is more virulent than the west african strain. the mpv genome is > 96% identical to the variola virus genome. however, mpv is not a direct ancestor or descendent of variola virus.
not completely understood; most bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals (mainly wild rodents) as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes. african rodents replicate bunv and develop viremia. livestock (goats, sheep, cattle), horses and rodents are hosts for gerv as shown by seroprevalence studies. amplifying hosts for cvv are mainly large mammals (caribou, deer, horses, sheep).

bite of infective female sandfly. rare reports exist of non-vector transmission, including transmission by blood transfusion, sharing of syringes, venereal contact, and possibly transplacentally; potential transmission via organ transplantation.
leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ‘daily lives,’ mainly during heavy rainfall. most foci are found in latin america and the caribbean, india, southeast asia, oceania, and eastern europe. the agent favors warm, humid environments. the prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present, local environmental conditions, local occupation, and agricultural practices. protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs, like mining, sewermaintenance, farming, veterinary work, and the military. in the tropics, occupational exposures (rice and sugar cane farming, fishing) and other agricultural activities remain an important risk. leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums, especially during rainy seasons. also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks.
self-limiting disease. sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. patients eventually recover completely.

fasciolopsis buski, a large trematode worm that can be up to 75 mm long.
domestic and free living ungulates (cattle, sheep, and goats). also found in other livestock, birds, pets (cats and dogs), and ticks. infected animals are generally asymptomatic, but infection may lead to late abortion.
serology (acute and convalescent sera) using the microscopic agglutination test (mat). isolation of leptospira from blood or csf during first 10 days of illness and urine during the 2nd and 3rd weeks; pcr may provide early diagnosis. dark-field microscopy is not recommended.
pasteurize milk; do not eat unpasteurized dairy products, especially in endemic areas; brucellosis control in domestic animals; hygienic measures in farms and slaughter houses; screening of livestock. laboratory infections occur where biosafety measures are not adequate.
immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. in the later stage of the disease, the metacestode may grow into neighboring organs (e.g. through the diaphragm into the lungs), and metastases can form anywhere. the differential diagnosis is hepatic cirrhosis or carcinoma. the disease can be fatal.
probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in panama and french guiana, also in the usa from a north-bound migratory bird. antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
praziquantel; surgery in case of biliary obstruction.
about 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
undulant fever, malta fever, mediterranean fever.
by bite or direct percutaneous contact, mucosal or respiratory exposure to blood, tissues, fluids or lesions of infected animals. in africa, transmission mainly occurs through butchering infected wildlife for food. person-to-person transmission probably occurs through direct contact with infected tissue/fluid, respiratory droplet spread, and indirect via contaminated objects.
anthrax has a worldwide distribution. livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.there is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. gi anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the usa in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. there is an enzootic cycle, mainly between c. taralsis and passerine birds. there is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. humans and horses are dead-end hosts for weev because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
streptomycin is recommended, with gentamicin as an alternative. tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases.
ancylostomiasis, necatoriasis, uncinariasis, ground itch.
pcr on blood or skin biopsy, or ifa on the latter. serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
for w. bancrofti: culex quinquefasciatus, anopheles spp., and aedes spp. in the pacific islands; for b. malayi: mansonia, anopheles, and aedes; for b. timori, an. barbirostris. anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than culex spp., and culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.
giant intestinal fluke infection.
high fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, maculopapular rash beginning on the face, spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet. characteristic small white spots (koplik spots) on the buccal mucosa. complications may consist of otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheal bronchitis (croup), blindness, severe skin infections, severe diarrhea and encephalitis, sometimes fatal. complications are more common and more severe in people with malnutrition, vitamin a deficiency, and chronic diseases. very rarely, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may appear years later.
in the usa, an average of only 6 neuroinvasive cases of eee are reported annually. the annual number of cases has declined in recent years. incidence is similar among different age groups and ethnicities, but it is twice as high among men. persons aged over 50 and under 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease. in north america, outbreaks occur during the mosquito season. in tropical south america transmission to horses is year-round, but human cases are rare. culiseta breeds in swampy areas in woodland, transmitting the virus from marsh-nesting birds to horses kept in such areas; unvaccinated horses often die. outbreaks in mexico and islands of the caribbean have all been due to the north american subtype, indicating spread by migratory birds. south american strains are distinct and of three different lineages, probably determined by the range of different rodent hosts. only a single human case has been reported from brazil, and none from guatemala, belize, colombia, ecuador peru, cuba, or trinidad and tobago in spite of detection of the virus in mosquitoes or horses in those countries. the virus has also been isolated from horses in eastern canada.
animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.

personal anti-mosquito precautions. adulticide spraying is practiced in areas where horse cases appear. a human vaccine against only the north american strain is available for laboratory personnel.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
sars coronavirus (sars-cov) is a positive-sense, single-stranded, enveloped rna virus of the family coronaviridae. the viral membrane contains a transmembrane (m) glycoprotein, spike (s) glycoprotein, and envelope (e) protein. coronaviruses derive their name from the crown-like (coronalike) morphology on electron microscopy.
although sars-like coronaviruses with very high genetic homology to sars-cov have been identified in masked palm civets, civets are thought to be a non-reservoir, spillover species. horseshoe bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of the progenitor of the sars virus.
especially prevalent in pig-rearing regions of southeast asia, where it is estimated that 10 million people are infected. the disease is most common in lowlands where the snail host is present and it is common practice to fertilize water plants with pig or human feces. disease spread is facilitated by heavy rainfall and extensive flooding, leading to fecal contamination of the water. highest incidence and intensity of infection is found in 10 to14 year old children (no sex difference), probably because they pick and consume water plants when they play. in foci of parasite transmission, the prevalence of infection in children ranges from 57% in mainland china to 25% in taiwan, and from 50% in bangladesh and 60% in india to 10% in thailand. water morning glory (ipomoea aquatica), water caltrop (trapa bicornis), lotus (nymphaea lotus), water cress (neptunia oleracea), and water hyacinth (eichhornia speciosa) are most responsible for human infection, but cysts also float on the surface and may be drunk.
colorado tick fever virus (ctfv), a prototype virus of the genus coltivirus of the family reoviridae; a spherical, enveloped virus with a double-stranded rna genome of 12 segments.
the disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. patients are classified as having either pl or ml. pl is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ml is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. skin lesions are often symmetric. involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.
world wide, but close to elimination in the americas and targeted for elimination in europe by 2015. in the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. crs is also grossly underreported. for example, it is estimated that over 45,000 crs cases occur annually in southeast asia yet only an average of 13 crs cases per year were reported to who between 2000 and 2009. rubella is a public health concern because of crs and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 crs cases occurred annually in developing countries. paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of crs if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. in 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of crs, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in crs cases.
yersinia pestis, a gram-negative bacillus. y. pestis is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
p. ovale initally was thought to be limited to sub-saharan africa, papua new guinea, eastern indonesia, and the philippines. it is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the middle east, the indian subcontinent, and various parts of southeast asia. p. ovale has not yet been reported in south america. in general, p. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in west africa prevalences above 10% are observed. also, infections are most common in children <10 years. there is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, p. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
