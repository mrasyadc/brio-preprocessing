the disease ecology is not completely understood. humans are likely dead end hosts.
flies can contaminate foods.
mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.urinary carriagemay occur in areas where schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
japanese encephalitis virus (jev), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense rna flavivirus. it is divided into five antigenic groups and four genotypes, whichmay belinked to differences in virulence.
buruli ulcer is named after buruli county in uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. the disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. west africa is the most affected region. typical buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. in southern australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. it is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. world wide, mainly children are susceptible to buruli ulcer disease.
chemotherapy is ineffective for treating aggressive forms of atl. there is no satisfactory treatment for ham/ tsp. access to adequate counseling and correct information about htlv is of fundamental importance for htlv-1 seropositive individuals.
the diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features. the bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis.
ticks introduce babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. the sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. the gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
hme, hga: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. hme cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. reinfection can occur. cfr is 2.7% for hme, <1% for hga, and absent for e. ewingii infection.
drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. there is an up to 10% relapse rate.
loiasis occurs in areas where the chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of central africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. the prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. it has been proposed that areas where the loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
benznidazole, pentamidine, melarsoprol, eflornithine, suramin, and nifurtimox are effective in acute cases; melarprosol and eflornithine can have saes. patients need to be followed up for 1–2 years.
most south and several central american countries between 23 n and 34 s have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions, particularly brazil, colombia, venezuela, and argentina. the prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75% in adults, with active disease developing in approximately 2% of infected individuals. the endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams, mild temperatures, a short winter, and a summer with moderate rain. the disease mainly affects active rural workers (coffee, cotton, and tobacco farmers), probably due to environmental exposure. this explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years. postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form. contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis.
rats (rattus, particularly r. norvegicus and bandicotta spp.). infected dogs, wild mammals, and marsupials have been found, but do not contribute to the spread of the disease.
infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. onset is often insidious. common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. cough may be prominent. symptoms can come and go. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. hiv-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
tetanus spores enter the body through wounds and under anaerobic conditions, the spores germinate and produce toxin. the toxins are disseminated via the blood and lymphatic system and bind to nerve endings, preventing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. this results in unopposed skeletal muscle contraction.
serology (igm elisa, ifa); rt-pcr. virus isolation is difficult.
ixodid wood tick (dermacentor andersoni).
epidemic non-a non-b hepatitis, fecal–oral non-a non-b hepatitis, enterically transmitted nona non-b hepatitis.
hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
use of safe water by filtering or boiling or disinfection with temephos (insecticide). avoid wading in contaminated water, especially people with an apparent worm. there is no vaccine, but tetanus toxoid may be given to prevent tetanus. the global guinea worm eradication programme is led by the carter center, cdc, who, un children’s fund and the individual efforts of endemic nations.
tetracycline, doxyxyline. alternative: chloramphenicol.
demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; pcr tests have been developed for the different leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. the montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
falciparum malaria, malaria tropica, tropical fever, blackwater fever, paludism, marsh fever.
fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. there they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. when the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. in some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
principally humans; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods, other zooplankton. crabs, shrimps, and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells.
main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host. the virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito. after several days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
wildlife–tick–wildlife. the tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. the virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular gramnegative bacterium.
ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals, and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates – these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans. humans are accidental hosts.
malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the thai–cambodian border region. uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts); the choice of acts is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an act or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
environment (soil) to human. fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs.
self-limiting disease.
rotavirus diarrhea, acute viral gastroenteritis, severe viral gastroenteritis.
together with tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, penicilliosis is a common opportunistic infection in hiv patients in southeast asia. though we could not find a report from myanmar, it is expected to be present there. in northern thailand it causes 15% of the hiv-related diseases. before the hiv epidemic it was a rare disease in immunocompromised patients residing in endemic areas in asia. cases of penicilliosis have been described world wide, mainly in hiv patients with a travel history to endemic regions. a single case has been described from ghana where there was no clear travel history to southeast asia. the association between bamboo rats and human infection is unclear. there is an association between infection risk and doing agricultural work, suggesting that soil exposure is a risk factor. the disease has a seasonal pattern with more cases during the rainy season.
none.
fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. they may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. chest xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
proper cooking, or freezing of fish at 20 c for 7 days destroys the parasite. abandon use of human feces to fertilize fish ponds.
none.
virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or rt-pcr; serology (igm elisa, ifa). virus isolation should be done in a bsl-4 laboratory.
detection of eggs in feces (eggs resemble those of fasciola hepatica). adult flukes may be seen in the stools or vomit.
bite of infected larval mites (chiggers). there is no direct person-to-person transmission.
not completely understood. possibly in the soil the fungus produces infective propagula that can become airborne, inhaled, and lead to respiratory infection. infections may also occur through traumatic lesions, but this has not been demonstrated.
for lbrf, borrelia recurrentis, a gram-negative spirochete. for tbrf, at least 15 borrelia species, each specific to a particular species of tick vector. since the 1980s, the number of new borrelia species associated with relapsing fever has increased, in part due to improved diagnostics.
serology (igm elisa, ifa of erythrocytes). diagnosis is confirmed by a significant ( > 4-fold) change in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. virus isolation or rna detection by rt-pcr from the blood or csf.
soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
depends on portal of entry. the skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. gi anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. untreated cutaneous anthrax has a cfr of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), gi anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
mayaro virus (mayv), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense rna virus, genus alphavirus in the family togaviridae, belonging to the semliki forest virus complex.
recovery of bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid, blood or fluid from arthritic joints; culture; pcr. streptococcus suis is often misidentified as another streptococcus species and therefore underdiagnosed.
surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye. diethylcarbamazine (dec) is filaricidal but can cause saes in patients with heavy infection. saes can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids. alternative: albendazole with a lower risk of saes in case of heavy infection.
s. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children and adults. risk factors for severe disease are: older age ( > 65 years), diabetes, chronic disease (heart, lung, kidney, liver), alcoholism, cancer, hiv, non-functioning or absent spleen, and sickle cell disease. a global burden of disease study estimated that in 2000 about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occurred world wide, leading to about 826,000 deaths in children <5 years. the most common presentation of severe disease is pneumonia. the majority of deaths (95%) occurred in africa and asia. since 2000 the pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced, mostly in developed countries,while developing countries need themmost. in 2008, 24 high-income and two middle-income countries had pneumococcal vaccination in their program, accounting for less than 0.2% of childhood pneumococcal deaths in 2000. many deaths in low-income countries are due to poor healthcare infrastructure and inadequate treatment options. penicillin and chloramphenicol are still widely used to treat meningitis despite high resistance levels against these agents in some areas. vaccination and access to proper treatment are needed in africa and asia. interventions should be targeted on countries with large populations and moderate incidence, and countries with high incidence and mortality.
headache, fever, chills. abdominal pain, renal impairment, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia may occur. coma and death are rare.
uncomplicated malaria: acute febrile illness with headache, chills, sweats, nausea, and vomiting; hepatosplenomegaly. findings of severe malaria can be: cerebral malaria (confusion, seizures, impaired consciousness to coma), hemolysis, severe anemia, hypotension, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and death. often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria ( > 5% infected erythrocytes).
principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
primary hiv infection is usually a nonspecific illness with fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and a sore throat. generalized lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash may occur. following primary infection there is a prolonged asymptomatic period before the appearance of the clinical manifestations of a loss of immune control over infectious pathogens and cancers. common presenting aids defining illnesses are tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, recurrent bacterial infections, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis, kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, and cmv disease.
rabies virus, a rhabdovirus of the genus lyssavirus, with a nonsegmented, negative-stranded rna genome. at least 11 different genotypes exist, with genotype 1, rabies virus (rabv) causing classic rabies world wide. genotypes 2–11 have a more limited host-range and geographic distribution: lagos bat virus (lbv), mokola virus (mokv), duvenhage virus (duvv), european bat lyssa virus 1 and 2 (eblv-1/2), australian bat lyssa virus (ablv), aravan virus (arav), irkut virus (irkv), khujand virus (khuv), and west caucasian bat virus (wcbv).
lpai viruses naturally circulate in wild birds, principally waterfowl and gulls, in which they generally cause no symptoms. lpai viruses are transmitted to terrestrial poultry (chickens, turkeys). lpai most likely evolved to hpai in aquatic birds (ducks and geese). transmission of hpai into migratory birds can result in large die-offs.
the natural reservoir is unclear. the fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (dasypus novemcinctus). the disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. as armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. by using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of p. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
since the global polio eradication initiative, cases have decreased significantly. there were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries afghanistan, india, nigeria, and pakistan. in endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. in 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in tajikistan. most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in chad, angola, sudan, and the drc. this illustrates the difficulties of the global polio eradication program. risk is seasonal in the temperate climates, with highest risks during the warmer months.
eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). the copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. the larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. the larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.

female phlebotomine sandflies (phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p.chadaudi, p. longipes, p. pedifer)
brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. from infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
treponema pallidum ssp. endemicum (bejel), t. pallidum ssp. pertenue (yaws), and t. carateum (pinta), spirochetes that are morphologically and serologically similar to t. pallidum ssp. pallidum, the agent of syphilis.
this is unknown at present. m. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. in australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry m. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
freshwater operculate snails (mainly parafossarulus sp. and bithynia sp.).
depends on disease severity and type of disease. in areas with high penicillin resistance, ceftriaxone can be used for severe disease. in case of ceftriaxone resistance, vancomycin is used. for meningitis, dexamethasone is added to antibiotic treatment.

by mosquito bite. there is no person-toperson transmission.
rubella specific igm or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples; rt-pcr or virus isolation from throat swab, or other specimens in crs.
snail–human–snail. infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). the cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water, enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver. when matured to adult male and female worms, they migrate to the abdominal veins (s. mansoni, s. intercalatum, s. guineensis) or pelvic veins (s. haematobium), mate and produce eggs. snails remain infectious for up to 3 months, humans for more than 10 years.

who recommended regimen (directly observed treatment short-course or dots) is 2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin plus isoniazid. if resistance to rifampicin or isoniazid is suspected, treatment must continue with second-line drugs for at least 18 months. drug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr and xdr-tb) require special regimens. mdr-tb is defined as resistance to two main first-line tb drugs: isoniazid and rifampicin. xdr-tb (extensive drug resistant tb) is defined as mdr-tb with resistance to fluoroquinolones and one second-line injectable drug.
many species of mosquitoes of the genera aedes, mansonia, culex, and anopheles.
small wild mammals such as rodents, snowshoe hares, deer and vector mosquitoes (venereal and transovarian transmission occur). dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of lacv, as the main vector (aedes triseriatus) only bites in daytime. for this reason, nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with lacv. the white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for jcv (horses can also be an amplifying host). snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of sshv.

early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). proper bodily hygiene.
the tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. as the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
salmonella enterica enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi), a gram-negative bacillus. s. typhi belongs to salmonella serogroup d and possesses somatic antigen o9, a single flagellar antigen hd, and virulence antigen vi. s. paratyphi a can cause similar disease.
hendra virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including urine, saliva, and nasal discharge, or during autopsy of infected horses. nipah virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including bat saliva (on fallen fruit and in date palm sap), or droplets from coughing infected pigs. in bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission.
none.

primarily old world fruit-eating bats, mainly in the family pteropodidae.
freshwater snails: biomphalaria spp. for s. mansoni, bulinus spp. for s. haematobium, s. intercalatum, and s. guineensis. technically, humans are the ‘vector’ as they harbor the parasite’s sexual stage. snails are intermediate hosts.
noma is an opportunistic infection with endogenous buccal flora.
each virus is associated with either one or a few closely related species of rodents, which constitute the virus’s natural reservoir. tacaribe complex viruses in the new world are generally associated with rats and mice (family muridae, subfamily sigmodontinae). the reservoir rodents are chronically infected, and the virus is transmitted among them, leading to lifelong viremia and virus excretion, and they do not die. the reservoir for junin virus is calomys musculinus and c. laucha, for machupo virus, c. callosus, for guanarito virus zygodontomys brevicauda, and for whitewater arroyo virus neotoma albigula. for sabia and chapare viruses the reservoir host is unknown.
microscopic examination of sputum for eggs (acid-fast staining destroys eggs), and examination of feces after using concentration techniques; elisa for serology.
similar to syphilis, the clinical manifestations can be classified into early and late stages. early-stage lesions are generally infectious and may last up to 5 years, with periods of latency. the disease has a relapsing clinical course with mainly skin manifestations, which is the only finding in pinta. in yaws and endemic syphilis there is also involvement of the mucous membranes and the bones. cardiovascular and neurological lesions are extremely rare.
supportive; ribavirin is effective if given within the first 6 days; dialysis if indicated.
pulmonary distomiasis, lung fluke disease
supportive.
leishmania species, protozoa, members of the trypanosomatidae family, order kinetoplastida. based on development characteristics in the sandfly, leishmania species are classified into the subgenera viannia and leishmania, within which there are various species complexes. leishmania species causing (muco)cutaneous disease in the americas are: l. (viannia) braziliensis (espundia), l. (viannia) colombiensis, l. (leishmania) mexicana (chiclero ulcer), l. (leishmania) pifanoi, l. (viannia) liansoni, l. (leishmania) garnhami, l. (leishmania) amazonensis, l. (viannia) panamensis, l. (viannia) guyanensis (forest yaws), and l. (viannia) peruviana (uta). l. infantum/ chagasi can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. l. chagasi is considered to be the same species as l. infantum, and will be referred to as l. infantum/chagasi.
detection of virus in respiratory specimens, stool or blood by rt-pcr; virus isolation; serology by ifa or elisa. specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures (bsl-3).
mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.
hard ticks (ixodidae). the brown dog tick (rhipicephalus sanguineus), the principal vector of msf, isf, itt, and af, is most active during spring and summer, has a low human affinity, and prefers dogs in a peridomestic environment. the southern african bont tick (amblyomma hebraeum) and a. africanum are the principal vectors of r. africae in southern africa. a. hebraeum is an aggressive, human-biting tick and has high rates of rickettsia infection, and atbf cases therefore often occur in clusters. see key references for further reading on ticks and tick-borne rickettsioses.
by inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodent host, or contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. nosocomial transmission is regular in resource-constrained settings.
knowlesi malaria, simian malaria
in 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new s. typhi cases and 216,500 deaths, with large regional variability. these estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease. typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in south central and southeast asia and south africa. two seasonality patterns are observed: (1) higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water, and (2) higher incidence in the rainy season, due to spillover from sewage to drinking water. declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved, mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation (see water and sanitation map).
microscopy of giemsa-stained blood film; differentiation from p. vivax can be difficult and result in misidentification; parasite load is generally low and may be undetectable by light microscopy; in regions where p. falciparum/p. vivax predominate, p. ovale is frequently overlooked; parasitemia is present for about 2 weeks; pcr.
an estimated 650 million people are at risk in 10 provinces of china. the distribution is closely correlated with the habit of consuming raw terrestrial molluscs, reptiles, or amphibians. the majority of cases are in adults, except in taiwan where most cases are in children. pomacea canaliculata, a snail native to south america, was imported into taiwan in 1981 as a food source and then into mainland china. it has replaced a. fulica as the main intermediate host of a. cantonensis and has become the main source of human infection in taiwan and mainland china. depending on the region, up to 70% of p. canaliculata can be infected. eating raw frogs also lead to human infections in china, and the usa. consumption of lizards caused several cases in thailand, sri lanka, and india. cases have been seen in at least five countries in europe and new zealand in travelers returning from endemic regions. malnutrition and debilitating diseases can exacerbate the infection.
vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccine should be routine for children (minimum age: 12 months), preferably with the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (mmr), with a booster at age 4 to 6 years. infected children should be kept out of school and away from other child contacts. displaced persons (e.g. refugees) should be vaccinated within a week of their arrival in a camp. for postexposure prophylaxis, vaccination is recommended within 72 hours of exposure, with a booster in 5–6 weeks; human immunoglobulin for immunocompromised persons and those for whom vaccine is contraindicated.
from asymptomatic to fatal. acute febrile illness with chills, headache, severe myalgia (with mild rhabdomyolysis), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. less common findings are hepatomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, and aseptic meningo-encephalitis. pulmonary symptoms may occur varying from cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, to adult respiratory distress syndrome. weil disease is a severe form of leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and hemorrhage with a cfr of 5–20%.

unknown.
taeniosis: praziquantel. neurocysticercosis: treatment must be individualized case by case but could include cestocidal drugs (albendazole or praziquantel), symptomatic measures (antiepileptic drugs, oedema reducing drugs, ventriculoperitoneal shunt) and removal by neurosurgery (limited indications).
mainly ochlerotatus vigilax and culex annulirostris. aedes camptorhynchus, a. normanensis, a. notoscriptus, and coquillettidia linealis are vectors in some circumstances.
prevention is focused on eliminating bse in cattle, preventing infected bovinematerial entering the animal and human food chain, and reducing the risk of secondary transmission to humans in the healthcare setting. to this end many countries have banned bovine meat and bone meal from livestock feed, slaughtered infected herds, and taken other precautions to prevent infected cattle from entering the human food chain. measures to reduce the risk of transmission of vcjd through blood products include low-risk sourcing and leucodepletion. further precautionary methods to reduce the risk of transmission through contaminated surgical instruments.

half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease. the most common presentations of acute q fever are pneumonia, hepatitis, and isolated fever. other symptoms are neurological (headache, confusion, peripheral neuropathy), sore throat, chills, sweats, rash, and non-productive cough. proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status. cfr: 1–2%. chronic q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease (valve abnormality).
rat bite fever is a rare and underreported disease with a worldwide distribution. s. minus infection is reported less frequently than s. moniliformis and occurs mainly in asia, particularly japan. world wide, millions of people are bitten by animals each year and rats are responsible for about 1% of these bites. it is estimated that 2% of rat bites lead to an infection (all causes). it is unknown what the proportion of rat bite fever is of these infections. the relation between humans and animals is changing which may alter the epidemiology of rat bite fever. rats have become a pet in several countries, while it used to be considered a pest. children handling pet rats may be a special risk group. more than half of the reported cases of rat bite fever occur in children.
percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g. semen, vaginal fluid, saliva) of an infected individual. person-to-person transmission via sexual contact, needle sharing in ivdus, sharing toothbrushes or razors, and blood transfusion. transmission does not occur via kissing, coughing, or sneezing. mother to child transmission occurs mainly during birth or transplacentally (not via breastfeeding).

self-limiting conjunctivitis, including watery or mucopurulent discharge. typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy. repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis. trichiasis damages the corneal surface, resulting in keratitis, vascularization of the cornea, and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection. corneal damage produces corneal scar, leading to blindness.
anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine available.
vivax malaria is the second most important malaria species after p. falciparum and accounts for 25–40% of the cases world wide with 132–391 million cases per year. outside africa it is the dominant species, mainly in asia. the distribution is wider than p. falciparum as it is able to develop at lower temperatures and can form hypnozoites in human liver. the high prevalence of duffy negativity in western africa has influenced the epidemiology of p. vivax, as duffy-negative people are apparently resistant to vivax malaria, although several reports suggest that duffy-negative people can be infected with p.vivax. the disease burden is greatest in infants. in 2010, an autochtonous p.vivax case was diagnosed in north eastern spain. malaria was declared eradicated from spain in 1964. p.vivax may have been transmitted by the local vector anopheles atroparvus, which can transmit asiatic p. vivax strains.
10–30 days in the vector after first infected meal, then 5–42 days in the reservior host.
vcjd is characterized by a relatively early age of onset (28 years) and prominent early psychiatric symptoms: anxiety, depression, agitation, delusions, and unpleasant sensory symptoms. neurological features are: unsteadiness, difficulty walking, and involuntary movements. memory loss progresses to severe cognitive impairment and, at the time of death, patients have become unable to move or speak. the median duration of illness is 14 months.

mainly humans. in southeast asia, monkeys, wild carnivores, dogs, and cats may also be infected with b. malayi. w. bancrofti has no known reservoir host.
there is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses. group c viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the americas, and were first described in the brazilian amazon in the 1950s. studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts, leading to genetic reassortment. genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the americas. nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported, from mexico to brazil. there is no sex or age preference for infection. inapparent and mild infections are common, overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas.
serology (igm and igg elisa) on acute and convalescent sera; cross-reactivity exists leading to misidentification. rt-pcr has been used to test human brain tissue samples.

rotavirus antigen detection by eia and other serological techniques; rt-pcr.
freshwater snails: oncomelania spp. for s. japonicum, robertsiella spp. for s. malayensis, neotricula spp. for s. mekongi.
for interrupting transmission: mass treatment with a single dose of albendazole or ivermectin combined with diethylcarbamazine citrate (dec) once a year for at least 5 years; or the regular intake of dec-fortified salt for at least one year; individual treatment: dec can worsen onchocercal eye disease and cause serious adversere actions in patients with loiasis. pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is largely due to the immune response to their endosymbiotic wolbachiabacteria, therefore doxycycline may be used. the treatment for hydrocele is surgery.
cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and fever can develop when the worms move through the lungs. in about 5 to 14 days the larvae reach the central nervous system, leading to subacute meningitis. eosinophilic meningitisis defined asmeningitiswith > 10 eosinophils/ml in csf or at least 10% eosinophils in the total csf leukocyte count. some caseshavelow-grade fever and temporary facial paralysis. signs of raised intracranial pressure, like diplopia. worms occasionallyenter theeye.thecourse of theillnessranges from a fewdays to several months. death is rare.
loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases. typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings (calabar swellings) which are angiedemas. these swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs, especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement. less frequently: giant urticaria, arthritis, and fever. the adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye. encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis. these saes mainly occur in those with heavy infection ( > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood).

90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. e. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
bird–mosquito–bird, with accidental dead-end infections in humans, equines, and other vertebrate animals.
the limits of p. falciparum malaria is determined by the presence of vector species and control measures within a certain region. p. falciparum malaria causes approximately 500 million cases each year and around one million deaths in sub-saharan africa. in 2007 almost 60% of the 2.4 billion people at risk of malaria were living in areas with a stable risk of p. falciparum. high endemicity was most common and widespread in the african region. in the americas, those at risk were all in the low endemicity class. in asia 88% are in the low endemicity class, 11% in the intermediate class, and 1% in the high endemicity class. recent progress is being made by the global malaria action plan to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality world wide and have a vision for malaria elimination. ranking countries on the possibility of elimination shows that it is most feasible in the americas and several countries in asia and the west pacific. it is least feasible in africa, where much of west and central africa need more than 90% reduction in transmission.
ehrlichiosis occurs worldwide, principally following the distribution of the transmitting tick vectors and reservoir species. less is known of the epidemiology and ecology of e. chaffeensis as compared to a. phagocytophilum. most hme cases are reported in the south-central and eastern usa, where a. americanum reaches high population densities. approximately 70% of hme cases occur from may to july in the usa, corresponding to the peak feeding activity period of the ticks. hme is most commonly diagnosed in adults, with a male-to-female ratio of > 2:1. most hme cases are single and not clustered. recreational or occupational activities in rural tick-infested habitats are at risk. majority of the cases have a history of a tick bite. ehrlichiosis is often not recognized in africa, where the primary diagnostic focus is malaria and typhoid fever. sennetsu fever occurs in asian regions where the eating of raw fish is common, such as in japan. n. sennetsu has been detected in the climbing perch in laos, a fish common throughout the mekong river, basin. climbing perch is widely distributed and eaten in asia.
ticks of the genera amblyomma and ixodes.
approximately 150,000 to 200,000 patients with hfrs are hospitalized each year throughout the world, more than half of them in china. the main agent of hfrs in asia is htnv. seov is also an important cause, but has a wider distribution. the most prevalent hantaviral disease in western and central europe is caused by puuv, with > 9,000 cases per year. dobv is restricted to the balkans. hantaviral disease is seasonal, linked to the activity of the rodent host. hfrs epidemics are associated with rodent abundance, caused by various seasonal factors. during the agricultural season, infection is linked to outdoor activities, and during the winter, rodents seek shelter in and around buildings and infection is contracted indoors. there have been reports of clinical hantaviral infections in the uk and there is serological evidence of human infection in israel, kuwait, laos, malaysia, philippines, thailand, and vietnam and in several african nations.

for lbrf, humans; for tbrf, wild rodents, bats and ticks (by trans-stadial and transovarian transmission). b. duttonii has thus far not been detected in wild animals, only in humans and tick vector o. moubata. livestock may also become infected.
most infections produce few or no symptoms. acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. the entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. after a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. group i t. cruzi, rare north of the amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. group iit. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. aids patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. cfr from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.
food-borne and transplacental (mother to child). ingestion of l. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide. development of the disease depends on the host immunity.
gradual onset of malaise, headache, and retro-orbital pain, conjunctivitis, fever, and sweats, followed by prostration. petechiae on the soft palate are frequent, on the body with ecchymoses less frequent. in severe cases: epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematuria, and gingival hemorrhage. enceplalopathy, intention tremors, depressed deep tendon reflexes, bradycardia, and hypotension with shock are common. infection during pregnancy can result in abortion. convalescence may be prolonged. cfr due to these viruses, even after intensive hospital treatment, can be as high as 33%.
infections are often mild, with more severe neurologic disease in 4–14% of the cases that may progress to death. veev infection often presents like an influenza-like illness. severe encephalitis is less common in adults as compared to children. absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and mayaro fevers. about 30% of survivors have neurological sequelae. cfr for vee is <1%. veev infection may cause stillbirths.
katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis, caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain. katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals (e.g. travelers) and relatively rare among local residentswith exposure since childhood. s. japonicum causes intestinal schistosomiasis with: diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, hepatosplenomegaly. chronic infection leads to liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, anemia, and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children; seizures due to egg granulomas in brain or spinal cord. infection does not produce full immunity, so reinfection occurs. s.mekongi causes similar, but milder, disease compared to s. japonicum.
hib is transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.

the first hantavirus found in the new world was sin nombre virus in the ‘four corners’ area (usa) in 1993, where an outbreak occurred of severe pulmonary disease in previously healthy adults. since then, sporadic outbreaks have been detected throughout the americas, with new strains and reservoir hosts. approximately 200 cases of hps per year are reported in the americas. there is no hps in the caribbean, probably because the rodent host sigmodontinae is infrequent there. the number of cases is much smaller than that of hfrs in the old world, but the cfr is higher. cases confirmed by serology have been reported in colombia and venezuela but the identity of the hantavirus unknown. seoul virus (see hantavirus disease, oldworld map) seropositives in humans and rattus norvegicus are found in many port cities in the americas, spread by shipping, but without evidence of disease. risk of exposure to hantavirus is correlated with outdoor occupations such as agriculture, in which a person might encounter rodents or their excreta; the greatest risk is entering rodent-infested closed buildings. epidemiology differs by country and virus. in household contacts of index patients with hps in chile, the risk of secondary cases was 17.6% among sex partners and 1.2% among other household members. infection is more common in males, with most cases occurring within the 20–40 age group.
the ixodid ticks are both vector and reservoir. amblyomma americanum, dermacentor andersoni and d. variabilis (american dog tick) in canada and the usa, rhipicephalus sanguineus in mexico and central america, and a. cajennense from the southern states of the usa southwards as far as argentina. d. variabilis is the primary vector for rmsf in the usa. a. maculatum is the main vector of r. parkeri in north america and a. triste in south america.

vaccination of livestock and humans with occupational risk in endemic areas. antibiotic prophylaxis when exposed and vaccination in case of inhalation anthrax. infected animal carcases should be burned or deeply buried, preferably at the site of death.
clonorchiasis is the most common liver fluke in humans. estimates show that approximately 35 million people are infected world wide, of which 15 million are in china. in endemic areas, the highest prevalence is in adults over 30 years of age. the intensity of human infection depends on the eating habits of the population. in asia, eating raw fish is common together with alcohol consumption and, therefore, men are more often infected than women. the incidence is low in children. in china the prevalence in some regions is increasing, probably due to increased consumption of raw freshwater fish. the geographical extent of the disease is determined by snail distribution, the eating habits of the local population, and contamination of freshwater with egg-containing feces. in southern china the disease is maintained by the practice of using human feces in carp raising ponds to promote plankton growth, on which the fish feed. in non-endemic areas it appears in asian immigrants, and in people who consume raw, dried, smoked or pickled fish imported from endemic areas.
infection is often asymptomatic but as the adult worms live for 5–10 years, some will develop painful swelling (sometimes enormous) of legs or arms, and, in cases of bancroftian filariasis, the breasts or scrotum (hydrocele). up to 40% have renal involvement. acute cases may have high fever, recurrent lymphadenitis, and retrograde lymphangitis.
humans.
pertussis immunization has been successful in reducing the burden of pertussis disease and deaths, with around 150,000 cases reported in 2008 compared to almost 2 million cases in 1980. however, these figures must be interpreted with great caution since reporting is mostly based on clinical diagnosis, whichis not easyin neonates, older children, and adults. the who estimated that nearly 18 million cases and 254,000 deaths occurred in 2004, of which 90% were in developing countries. although pertussis disease has clearly been reduced by immunization, it is not clear to what extent immunization has reduced circulation of b. pertussis. the continued risk of pertussis in unimmunized infants and the persistence of epidemic cycles indicate that b. pertussis transmission continues despite vaccination programs. several developed countries with high coverage in children have experienced outbreaks of pertussis in adolescents and adults. immunity following natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not permanent, therefore high coverage with pertussis vaccines in children has shifted susceptibility and peak incidence to adolescents and young adults; these age groups are then transmitting infection to young infants. since pertussis in adults usually manifests as only a prolonged cough it is difficult to identify cases and protect infants.
personal anti-tick precautions. an inactivated mouse-brain vaccine is in use in russia and eastern europe. healthcare workers caring for cchf patients are at risk and need to take proper barrier precautions.
there are two different groups of etiologic agents: fungi and bacteria. fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma, and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated. the fungi madurella mycetomatis and pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma. bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated, of which the bacterial species of nocardia, streptomyces and actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma.

mosquitoes of the genera aedes, culex, mansonia and others. there is transovarian transmission of rvfv in mosquitoes. dried mosquito eggs can remain viable and infected for years. originally, the eggs are laid in the damp soil above the water line and hatch when flooded.
culiseta melanura: bird to bird; aedes or coquillettidia spp.: from bird to other vertebrates (including horses and humans). viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds, and the extrinsic cycle in mosquitoes lasts 2–3 days. horses and humans are dead-end hosts because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
female mosquito of the genus anopheles (see anopheles map).
application of residual insecticides or insecticidal paint inside dwellings, use ofinsecticide-treated bed nets, screening of blood and organ donors from infected areas. application of these methods has eradicated intradomiciliary transmission from uruguay (1997), chile (1999), guatemala (2005), brazil (2006), the eastern region of paraguay, andfive of the endemic provinces of argentina. honduras and nicaragua are awaiting certification of eradication. only the food-borne risk remains in those areas.
tbrf is primarily transmitted by ornithodoros ticks. lbrf is transmitted by the human body louse (pediculus humanus); neither the head louse nor the pubic louse has been shown to transmit the disease.
echinococcus multilocularis, a small (3–6 mm long) cyclophyllid cestode (tapeworm).
diphyllobothriosis, dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
depends on the type of infection and severity. s. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. it also is a common cause of otitis media and sinusitis. it can cause deep-seated infections involving any organ in a disseminated disease.

early stage disease: suramin for t. b. rhodesiense, pentamidine fort. b. gambiense; late stage disease: melarsoprol for both forms; eflornithine with or without nifurtimox for gambiense. these drugs can cause saes.
avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. an inactivated vaccine is available. specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
majority will be asymptomatic in the acute phase, but approximately 80% develops chronic hcv disease. acute disease: insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, nausea, malaise and vomiting; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine. most infected cases (approx. 80%) develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom; 20–30% even-tually develop severe liver disease: cirrhosis and liver cancer (may take 20 years and is dependent on the presence of other risk factors). hcv infection is an important cause for liver transplantation in developed countries. there is accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of hepato-cellular carcinoma in: men, elderly, obese, alcoholics, those infected with hiv or hepatitis b virus.
streptobacillosis: streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly actinobacillus muris, haverhillia multiformis), a gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium. spirillosis: streptobacillosis: streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly actinobacillus muris, haverhillia multiformis), a gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium.
the majority of infections are subclinical ( 95%). those with disease have mild fever, maculopapular rash often involving the palms and soles, which may be hemorrhagic and may recur, polyarthritis of both large and small joints, occasionally swollen extremities, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy. the disease is more severe in scandinavia and south africa than elsewhere. the disease is non-fatal, but moderate residual pain and stiffness in the joints may persist for years.
person-to-person transmission via fecal–oral route (hands, food, water, sexual contact).
the impact of sanitation, footwear, and health education is minimal. to reduce the disease burden of sths, mass treatment campaigns with benzimidazoles and praziquantel are undertaken, and sanitation and access to clean water improved. as most sths occur in children, control efforts are targeted at schools. infective larvae can survive in soil for several months.
b. quintana multiplies in the louse’s intestine and is excreted in the feces. body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching, by which the skin is inoculated with louses’ contaminated feces. chronic b. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread.
polysaccharide vaccines against a, c, y, and w135 are available. these vaccines are safe and effective in adults and older children but are poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 2 and the duration of protection is limited to 3–5 years. the development of a group c conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is effective in children under the age of 2 years has been an important advance, and conjugate vaccines are now available for a, c, y, and w135. the development of a group b vaccine remains a challenge. chemoprophylaxis of close contacts eradicates carriage and reduces the incidence of secondary cases. vaccination of household contacts may also prevent further cases.
mosquitoes. in north america, the primary vector of weev for the enzootic cycle is culex tarsalis. weev is transmitted to humans and horses by bridging mosquitoes (e.g. ochlerotatus melanimon and aedes species).
person-to-person transmission occurs parentally (blood to blood). mother to child transmission or transmission via sexual contact is rare. mother to child transmission increases if the mother is co-infected with hiv.
direct contact of abraded skin or conjunctival mucosa to urine of infected animals or exposure to environmental sources where urine is deposited. infection via ingestion is uncommon.

by tick bite or blood transfusion. most transmission to humans is by the nymphal tick stage.
in africa, the principal vectors are the sylvan mosquitoes ae. furcifer and ae. africanus, ae. luteocephalus, and ae. taylori; in asia, urban ae. aegypti, ae. albopictus, and various culex species.
up to one-third of cases are subclinical. the illness begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and headache followed by unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral tender swelling of the parotid (parotitis) or other salivary glands. parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). the commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis, which is seen in up to 10% of cases but is self-limiting and does not result in death of disability. other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
it is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions (e.g. farmers, soldiers). dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. as the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
hookworm morbidity is higher in patients infected with large numbers of adult parasites. attachment of the hookworm to the intestinal mucosa results in loss of blood, eventually resulting in anemia and malnutrition in chronic cases. chronic hookworm infection can impair cognitive and growth development in children.
chagas disease.
doxycycline for acute q fever. chronic q fever endocarditis: a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for approximately 18 months.
f. tularensis tularensis type a is found in north america and the distribution is associatedwith wild rabbits, ticks, and tabanid flies. type b is found throughout the northern hemisphere, mainly in eurasia and is associated with multiple rodent species, hares, ticks, blood-feeding mosquitoes, and tabanid flies. there is also an association with water bodies (streams) and flooding. in the usa, around 200 human tularemia cases are reported each year, mostly in rural areas during summer months. in europe, most cases are reported from sweden, finland, and russia, and is recently emerging in spain. rural populations are most at risk (e.g. farmers, hunters). human outbreaks often coincide with wild animal outbreaks.

by mosquito bite.
mosquito (anopheles spp.), mainly bites between dusk and dawn (see anopheles map).
group a rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations. rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of <5 years. the incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries, but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure. control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access, hygiene, and sanitation. rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease. for vaccine introduction, knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed. the epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. the 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (g1–g4 and g9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with g1[p8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in north america, australia, and europe but only 30% of infections in south america, asia, and africa.

rats are the main host species involved in human rat bite fever for both agents. the main location for s. moniliformis in rats is the pharynx. s. minusis mainly present in the blood and tongue of rats and salivary glands of mice. other rodent species such as mouse, squirrel, and gerbil – and non-rodent species – have occasionally been identified as possible sources of infection. the rat population is estimated to be 10 billion, which is one-third of the total global mammalian population.
measles has a worldwide distribution, but is eliminated from the western hemisphere through vaccination. measles deaths world wide fell by 78% from an estimated 733,000 in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008; all regions but one have achieved the united nations goal of reducing measles mortality by 90%, however, it remains the leading cause of vaccinepreventable deaths in children and there are fears of a resurgence if vaccination falters for lack of resources. who figures for 2008 were 282,000 reported cases, with many thousands more unreported. some 58% of countries have 90% or more vaccine coverage, adequate to stop transmission, but endemic countries have case fatality rates of up to 30% in places. most measles deaths ( > 95%) occur in countries with a per capita income of <us$ 1,000. measles-free countries still have imported cases and limited outbreaks in subpopulations with low or no vaccination coverage (e.g. religious communities). measles is being considered for global elimination or even eradication.

respiratory diphtheria is classically associated with fever, inflammation of the pharynx or larynx, pseudomembrane formation, lymphadenopathy and edema of the soft tissues of the neck. however, most cases are mild and may resemble streptococcal pharyngitis and the pseudomembrane may be absent. the exotoxin of c. diphtheriae can cause polyneuritis and myocarditis. nasal diphtheria is usually mild and chronic with nasal discharge and ulceration. cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic, sharply demarcated ulcers with an adherent gray pseudomembrane. it is usually associated with skin infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococci.
l. monocytogenes can be detected from blood and csf by microscopy/culture or pcr. mri is indicated for suspected brainstem infection (rhombencephalitis). serology is not useful for diagnosis.
the global number of hookworm disease cases is estimated to be 740 million individuals, with the highest prevalence in sub-saharan africa and eastern asia. the majority (85%) of the hookworm infections are caused by necator americanus, which is the predominant hookworm of latin america, the caribbean, sub-saharan africa, and southeast asia. there is strong association between hookworm prevalence and poverty (see human development map). the remaining 15% infections by ancylostoma duodenale are in focal pockets in india, especially around uttar pradesh and west bengal, and in china north of the yangtze river. mixed infections may also occur. hookworm disease prevalence rises with age and plateaus in adults. disease is more prevalent where individuals walk barefoot in regions lacking sanitation (see sanitation map). hookworm larvae prefer sandy soil in mild humid climates, resulting that individuals living in coastal areas have the highest infection intensity.
deworming with mebendazole or albendazole; repeat treatment in case eggs are still detected in feces. iron supplementation to correct anemia.
multiple species of the spirochetal genus, including leptospira interrogans, which is the species associated withmost severe disease. there are currently 8 species found to be pathogenic for humans, associated with > 250 serovars belonging to the pathogenic species. antigenically related serovars are grouped into 24 serogroups. a single serovar may belong to different leptospira species.
direct contact with sick or dead poultry (most common) infected with hpai, and possibly via inhalation of virus-laden particles or contact of contaminated material with the eyes or respiratory mucosa. other postulated routes: ingestion of water contaminated with the feces of infected birds, consumption of undercooked products from infected birds. often, however, the route of exposure is not clear. limited person-to-person transmission of hpai h5n1 is possible following prolonged close contact with an infected patient.
e. histolytica is distributed world wide, especially in countries with poor sanitation and little access to clean water (see water and sanitation maps). it is estimated that e. histolytica is responsible for 40,000 to 100,000 deaths per year. most prevalence studies in the past did not distinguish between e. histolytica and the non-pathogenic e. dispar, and therefore little is known of the current disease prevalence of the pathogenic e. histolytica. e. histolytica infection is endemic in mexico, india, south africa, some central and south american countries, and asian pacific countries. community-based studies in urban slums in bangladesh showed that: 9% of preschool children suffer from amebic diarrhea each year, with 2% requiring a hospital visit. in developed countries, amebiasis is seen in travelers and immigrants from developing countries, and cases may also be found in closed psychiatric institutions. msm are also a risk group, since they are more exposed.
vivax malaria; recurring malaria; tertian malaria; paludism; marsh fever; ague.
eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail, where they develop to cercariae that encyst on aquatic plants (e.g. watercress) and become desiccation resistant metacercariae. after the plants are eaten by herbivores (e.g. sheep, cattle), or water containing metacercariae is drunk, the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, enter the liver, and lay eggs in the bile duct, which are then excreted in the feces. the whole cycle takes 3 to 4 months.
early phase: rt-pcr on blood; serology (igm and igg), but there is cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses; positive serology requires confirmation by more specific tests, like plaque-reduction assay.

detection of viral rna in blood by rtpcr; serology (igm elisa); virus culture.
human–copepod–human. adult female worm expels larvae through a hole in the skin of the leg or foot of an infected person into stagnant water where they are ingested by the vectors. the larvae become infectious in 2 weeks and when the vectors are ingested and digested, the larvae are freed and migrate into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and thorax. there they mature into adults. larvae are shed for 2–3 weeks, are viable in water for up to 5 days, and develop in the copepod for 2 weeks.
an estimated 7.6 million people are infected with t. cruzi and 75 million are at risk in mexico, central and south america, determined by the range of the vector. originally american trypanosomiasis was a disease of agricultural workers (mainly adult men) living in rural areas in poor housing conditions. in urban areas transmission is mainly via blood transfusion, and occasionally via ingestion of contaminated sugarcane juice or palm fruit juice. control programs between 1990 and 2006 resulted in the estimated annual number of deaths falling from more than 45,000 to 12,500, and the incidence of new cases from an estimated 700,000 to 41,200. chronic cases are diagnosed in non-endemic countries in immigrants. in the usa 300,000 immigrants have chagas disease, and an estimated 30,000 cases of chagas cardiomyopathy annually.

infections are generally asymptomatic to mild. wee can present as an influenza-like illness with sudden onset fever, severe headache, chills, and myalgia. other symptoms are: retro-orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. the disease can progress to more severe disease with encephalitis and death. encephalitis occurs in about 13% of infected cases. absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and mayaro fevers. younger children with wee are more severely affected neurologically and fatally. about 30% of infants develop serious neurologic sequelae. the overall cfr for wee is 3–7%.
human buccal flora.
mayv is enzootic in the humid tropical rainforests of south america. infections peak in the rainy season when the mosquito vectors are most abundant. most human cases occur sporadically and involve persons who work or reside in humid tropical forest; several small outbreaks of mayaro fever have been described in residents of rural communities of the amazon region of brazil, bolivia, and peru. travelers have imported mayv from surinam to the netherlands and from brazil into france. the virus has been detected in migratory birds.

by tick bite or crushing an infected tick or its feces into a break in the skin or mucous membrane. also by blood transfusion and, in the laboratory, aerosol.
two interacting cycles can be distinguished: (1) a persistent cycle in the aquatic reservoir, and (2) in the human host, leading to amplification through fecal–oral spread.
the disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of africa and asia. who reported 213,036 leprosy cases at the beginning of 2009. although the worldwide prevalence has declined in the last two decades, the incidence has remained the same. india had the most new cases in 2008 (134,000), followed by brazil (39,000), and indonesia (17,000). males are affected more than females (2:1); young children are rarely infected. epicurves for pl show a peak at age 15 followed by a trough at age 20. who considers that leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem in any country when the prevalence is less than 1 case per 10,000 population. in 2007, the drc and mozambique achieved that status. also india reported that their national prevalence is below 1/10,000. however, pockets of high endemicity still remain in some areas within those countries. decreased prevalence without a reduction in incidence maylead to an increase of cases as countries may be less committed to control them once they meet elimination status. foci in brazil are found in the amazonian jungle, but also in arid areas. poverty and crowded dwellings are important risk factors. leprosy in north america and europe has declined to zero cases in line with improvement in living conditions.
chronic follicular conjunctivitis.

hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite rna genome, that belong to the bunyaviridae family. hantaviruses are named after the hantan river area in south korea, where the first hantavirus (hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. old world and new world hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. old world hantaviruses shown on the map are: dobrava–belgrade virus (dobv), hantaan virus (htnv), puumula virus (puuv), and saaremaa virus (saav). seoul virus (seov) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
none.
eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, angiostrongyliasis
hygiene, access to clean water and sanitation. an oral cholera vaccine is available which is safe and provides sustained protection of > 50% that lasts for 2 years in endemic populations. the vaccine does not protect against infections with o139 strains. chemoprophylaxis for contacts may consist of tetracycline or doxycycline. breast-feeding protects infants. quarantine is ineffective. infection results in limited protection against homologous strains, but there is no cross-protection. cholera must be reported to national health authorities as small local outbreaks may become large epidemics.
hygiene; access to clean water; sanitation (see water and sanitation map). a vaccine has been developed and proven effective, but is not yet available.
rodent control; those with occupational exposure to rodents (e.g. sewage workers) should wear personal protective clothing; avoid close contact with reservoir animals, including pets; prophylaxis with penicillin or doxycycline following rat bite.
vaccination with vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides. both conjugated and non-jugated vaccines are available. conjugated vaccines targeting either 7, 9, 10, or 13 capsule types are recommended for children under 5 years of age and risk groups. the 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine can only be used in individuals older than 2 years and at high risk of disease. national surveillance of pneumococcal disease and infecting serotypes is required to detect vaccine escapees, requiring vaccine modification. individuals are not protected against pneumococcal capsule types not in the vaccine. through the gavi alliance, low-income countries can access pneumococcal vaccines with a small contribution. rwanda was the first gavi-eligible country that introduced the vaccine in 2009.
mosquito species that breedin rice fields and marshes, principally culex tritaenorhynchus group; also c. gelidus and c. vishnui.
weil disease, swamp fever, cane cutters disease, hemorrhagic jaundice, swineherd disease.
it is estimated that more than 207 million people are infected world wide, with 85% of them in africa. infection does not produce full immunity, so reinfection occurs. schistosomiasis is a water-based disease that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to irrigation projects or dams. man-made water bodies like dams can lead to changes in snail habitat and cause a shift from urogenital to intestinal schistosomiasis (egypt) and vice versa (senegal). s. mansoni was presumably introduced with the slave trade from west africa into south america and the caribbean s. intercalatum and s. guineensis are geographically restricted to central western africa.
hendra virus: pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of hendra virus and are asymptomatic. the viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine. the epidemiological reasons for the emergence of hendra virus infection in horses are not clear. all human cases had close contact with infected horses. nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in south asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season. in malaysia, it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms, and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing nipah virus was eaten by pigs, who became infected. nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in cambodia and thailand, and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in nw india, in the absence of reported pig or human disease. in bangladesh, there is epidemiologic evidence of bat–human transmission without an intermediate livestock host, and of human–human transmission. young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease. also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor. antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in madagascar (pteropus and eidolon sp.) and in ghana (eidolon sp.), but in the absence of virus isolation or rna detection, it is not possible to know which virus is involved. no human or animal cases have been reported in madagascar or in africa.
penicillin and metronidazole; rehydration; nutritional rehabilitation; treatment of predisposing diseases (e.g. malaria, measles, tuberculosis); wound disinfection; reconstructive surgery.
food for canning or bottling should be thoroughly cooked; consumption of inadequately smoked or salted food and uneviscerated fish should be avoided. also avoid honey and dusty excavation sites with infants. a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (pbt) vaccine is available from the cdc.
possibly mechanic transmission by non-biting flies (hippelates pallipes) in the transmission of yaws.
wild, migratory birds of the order passeriformes (mainlyfieldfare, redwing, and songthrush) and anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). tetraonid birds (grouse) population size changes coincide with sinv epidemics in finland. larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species.
humans (mainly l. donovani), wild canidae (foxes, raccoon dogs, jackals, wolves), domestic dogs (mainly l. infantum/chagasi), and rodents.
various vaccines are available; personal antimosquito precautions; intermittent irrigation of rice fields disrupts vector breeding; vaccination of pigs reduces amplification.
approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. in africa all htlv and stlv subtypes are found, and phylogenetic research suggest that htlv-1 originated in africa about 27,000 years ago. htlv-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age, with a peak incidence around age 50. among htlv-1 carriers, the lifetime risk of developing ham/tsp ranges from between 0.3% and 4%. for atl, this risk is estimated to be 1% to 5% and for htlv-1-associated diseases in general, including atl, ham/tsp, uveitis, polymyositis and arthropathy, the lifetime risk may be close to 10%. japan, africa, caribbean islands and south america are the areas of highest prevalence, but the reasons for this are unknown. most infections world wide are due to subtype htlv-1a. distribution of the infection is focal, e.g. brazil, japan, and iran, where htlv-1 is limited to certain areas of each country. on several japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37%. socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of htlv-associated infective dermatitis, since the disease has not been reported in htlv-1 epidemic japan. for non-endemic areas such as europe and north america, htlv-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas, their offspring and sexual contacts, among sex workers and ivdus.
veev was isolated for the first time in 1938 from a diseased horse in venezuela. the veev distribution is limited to the americas, and predominantly in central and south america. in 1995, a large outbreak with approximately 100,000 human cases, of which 300 were fatal, happened in colombia and venezuela. the guajira peninsula (region in northern colombia and northwest venezuela) has the highest disease burden, probably due to a large donkey population that serves as an amplifying host. in 2005, human vee cases were detected for the first time in bolivia, cause by a new bolivia–peru id genotype. typical veev enzootic habitats are lowland forests and swamps in (sub)tropical areas of the americas, from northern argentina up to southern usa (florida and colorado). enzootic subtype distribution generally does not overlap, except in the amazon regions.
foxes (including urban foxes) are the definitive hosts, wild rodents (mainly arvicolidae), voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts. foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas, partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination.
avoid ingesting raw freshwater fish. adequate cooking, freezing at 20 c for at least 7 days, or irradiation of fish or meat will kill encysted larvae. sanitation.

serological tests cross-react with htlv-2, requiring positive elisa to be confirmed by western blot, ifa, or radioimmunoprecipitation (ripa); rt-pcr.
infective sporozoites are inoculated by bite from anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites, or to a dormant stage (hypnozoite) that can become active after months or years, causing relapse. merozoites released from liver mostly infect reticulocytes that develop to schizonts, rupture and release merozoites that will infect new reticulocytes (this cycle takes 48 hours). gametocytes are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal.
demonstration of strongyloides larvae on repeated stool specimens by microscopy after concentration (coproculture or baermann). stool examination has poor sensitivity, particularly in chronic cases. serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, and perform better in chronic cases and are therefore used for screening patients at risk for hyperinfection. pcr has higher sensitivity than microscopy. hyperinfection: larvae or parasite dna can be found in sputum and other specimens.
human.

unknown.
pigs or humans ingest eggs from contaminated environment. adult tapeworms will only develop in humans after eating raw or undercooked pork containing cysticerci. it takes 2 months for larvae to become an adult worm and produce eggs (up to 300,000 eggs per day). in pigs, eggs invade the general circulation via the intestinal wall and migrate to skeletal and heart muscles where they form cysticerci.
boutonneuse fever (group name for r.conorii infections: msf, isf, itt), qtt and stt/natt: mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks, eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy (in isf, eschars are rare), generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4–5 days. the disease can be severe with a cfr up to 3%. atbf is milder than other rickettsioses, fever and rash are less common, multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy.
the parasite isingested by a tsetse fly during feeding on an infected host, and enters the salivary glands after 12–30 days, and can be transmitted to new susceptible hosts during the life of the fly (3 months). there is no vertical transmission in the fly.
supportive.
fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed c. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. the motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. when ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. the cycle takes approximately 3 months.

tick–vertebrate–tick, with humans as incidental hosts.
avoid eating raw slugs, snails, other molluscs, freshwater prawns, land crabs, and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds (e.g. watercress) from endemic areas.washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination. boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 c for 24 hours.
there are only about 5,000 cases of rrv and usually only a few hundred cases of bfv annually. peak incidence is in the 30–40 year age group, the disease is rare in children. rrv disease is the most common arboviral disease in aus tralia, accounting for about 90% of cases, often occurring in mixed epidemics with bfv disease on mainland australia (to which bfv is restricted). most bfv cases occur in queensland and are only sporadic. rrv cases have been reported from the island of new guinea and caused epidemics in pacific islands in 1979–1980. transmission occurs year-round, especially in coastal northern and northeastern australia, but is more intense during the mosquito season in most of the country. birds are presumed to be involved in spread around australia; a viremic tourist from australia is believed to have introduced the eastern topotype of rrv to the pacific islands. detailed epidemiological data is available on line at: http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/ source/cda-index.cfm.
acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting. usually does not last longer than 2 weeks.
endemic treponematoses is now rarely reported since the eradication campaign. complete eradication may have been achieved if surveillance was continued and rural healthcare services improved. disease foci still exist, but reports are lacking. several nations fail to report to avoid the stigma of ‘being backward.’ the who has estimated that 2.5 million people are still infected with endemic treponemes, and about 460,000 are actively infectious. the disease primarily afflicts children in tropical and subtropical areas. the distribution of endemic treponematoses is patchy and associated with poverty and poor access to social and healthcare services; it thus affects mainly rural communities in developing countries (see human development map). endemic syphilis generally affects individuals in hot, arid climates, and yaws affects those in hot and humid areas. pinta is found only in central and south america, but has not been reported for over 40 years. no endemic syphilis cases have been reported since the 1980s. yaws is also rare and currentlyis only reported from foci in west africa and indonesia. also, no new yaws cases have been reported in india since 2004. it has been suggested that the presence of non-venereal treponematoses indicates that the country or region has a poor-quality healthcare system.
avoid consumption of inadequately cooked marine fish. clean the fish early after they are caught as larvae migrate from viscera into fish flesh after death. freezing at 20 c for at least 7 days kills larvae. larvae can survive 50 days in vinegar. for allergic patients: avoid food that may contain allergen.

rare, but good disease burden data are lacking. underdiagnosis is common. there are four main types of botulism: intestinal/infant, food-borne, wound and inadvertent. infant botulism is the most common form of botulism in the usa and is caused by growth of spores germinating the immature gut of infants and releasing the toxin, or rarely in adults with abnormal intestinal tracts. honey is a common source, but in 85% of infants, the source is unknown. infant cases occur from 6 days to 12 months of age and affect equally both sexes. food-borne botulism is the result of eating fermented, salted, or smoked fish, seafood or meat that has not been cured for long enough to eliminate contamination. it is also due to incorrect home canning or bottling of vegetables or fruit. botulism usually occurs in outbreaks in those exposed to the same food. the largest numer of reported cases per country over the decade 2000–2009 in promed mail have occurred in thailand (83 cases from deer meat, 163 from bamboo shoots), poland (276 from preserved food), and georgia (217 from home-preserved – vegetables). food-borne botulism outbreaks occur in indigenous tribes in alaska and canada by consuming improperly preserved fish products (seal, salmon, salmon eggs). wound botulism results from failure to remove contaminated soil completely from wounds and sealing them, permitting anaerobic growth of the bacteria. inadvertent botulism is a recent phenomenon resulting from the use of diluted botulinum toxin to treat patients for several disorders and for cosmetic reasons.

junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. the range of junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. the other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. deforestation and human invasion into rodent habitat may have resulted in increased human exposure to infected rodents and a concomitant increase in human illnesses (see forest cover map). only single cases of an infection by sabia and chapare viruses have been recorded. pathogenicity of whitewater arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the californian cases.
oro-fecal. 100% of susceptible contacts become infected. virus appears in the throat < 36 hours after infection, for a week, and in the feces after 72 hours for 3–6 weeks. transmission through contaminated water and food has been reported rarely.
personal anti-mosquito precautions; vector control; screening blood and transplant products. there is no vaccine approved for human use. there are several veterinary vaccines.
hev is more prevalent in areas with hot climates and poor sanitation. outbreaks are more common during heavy rainfall and flooding, which leads to fecal contamination of the drinking water. food-borne outbreaks also occur, especially with contaminated shellfish. hev genotypes have their own geographic distribution. hev-1 is common in high endemic areas of asia and africa. hev-2 can be found in mexico andwest africa. hev-3 has been found in rare cases in the usa and several developed countries in europe, japan, australia, new zealand, korea, and argentina. hev-4 causes sporadic human cases in southeast asia and japan. hev-3 and hev-4 are also reported in pigs on all continents, causing sporadic disease in humans.
supportive, including rehydration. avoid aspirin because of potential hemorrhage.
the distribution of rmsf and r. parkeri rickettsiosis is limited by the tick vector distribution. average annual rmsf incidence of the disease in the usa was 2.2 cases per million between 1997 and 2002, and approximately 250–1,200 cases are reported each year. many cases of rmsf may actually have been caused by other rickettsial agents, as was seen with r. parkeri. many rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity are present in ticks and new disease causing agents are still being discovered. rmsf in the usa follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months, when ticks are most active. rmsf cases are usually found in rural areas, and less commonly in urban areas. residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of rmsf. rmsf is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters.
infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.

sinv has been isolated from africa, eurasia, and australia. the highest disease burden is in northern europe (approximately between 60 and 64 n) and south africa. evolutionary studies show that sinv likely originated from south america, with subsequent spread to north america, asia, and australia, with later spread to europe and africa. intererestingly, there are high levels of gene sequence similarities of sinv isolates within the same north–south axis, which correlates with major bird migration patterns (see bird migration map). preferred habitat is a wetland ecosystem. the disease is seasonal, coinciding with the period of mosquito abundance and reservoir presence. overwintering in the northern hemisphere may be by vertical transmission in the vectors. in scandinavia, most cases occur in july through september, when there is plenty of vector species. peak incidence in karelia is about one month after the peak in finland. highest attack rates in finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in finland, with the last epidemic in 2002. no epidemic occurred in 2009, probably due to a decline in the grouse population.
plasmodium ovale, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the phylum apicomplexa. phylogenetically, p. ovale clusters with other plasmodium species affecting simian primates.
only ardeid birds and pigs have a sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. the mosquito picks up the virus from the blood of a viremic host. after a few days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host when bitten. humans are incidental and dead-end hosts as viremia does not reach sufficient levels to infect mosquitoes.

it is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, such as papua new guinea, south africa, parts of india and indonesia, and among the aborigines of australia. some cases have been reported in the countries of central and south america and the caribbean. the disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors. in some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in hiv patients. in the usa, it is more common in african-americans, of people in lower socioeconomic status, and those with poor hygiene. it has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of k. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus, or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material. there is no gender difference in incidence; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. there are no reports of congenital infections, but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation. donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent hiv infection.

the estimated prevalence of strongyloidiasis is between 30 and 100 million infections in 70 countries world wide; however, the accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to poor performance of screening methods. most cases are found in tropical and subtropical areas (warm, moist). rarely, it is found in foci in north america and europe. it is of significance in developed nations as it can cause hyperinfection in immunocompromised patients that have been infected years before in an endemic region. the most important risk factor for hyperinfection is corticosteroid therapy; other risk factors are: hematologic malignancies, malnutrition, alcoholism, htlv-1 infection, and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplantation). interestingly, hyperinfection is not commonly seen in hiv-infected individuals in endemic countries.
klebsiella granulomatis, formerly calymmatobacterium granulomatis, a gram-negative facultative aerobic coccobacillus.
intestinal capillariasis starts with mild abdominal pain, borborygmus, and diarrhea, that develops to profuse watery diarrhea. if untreated: chronic diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption, leading to weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia, and eventually death. hepatic capillariasis (c. hepatica) is a (sub)acute hepatitis with eosinophilia, that may disseminate to other organs and can be fatal. pulmonary capillariasis (c. aerophila) may present with fever, cough, asthma, and pneumonia and may also be fatal.
each hantavirus has its specific rodent host. hps is generally caused by the sigmodontine-borne hantaviruses. phylogenetic analysis reveals that hantaviruses have a long co-evolutionary history with their host.
small rodents (mice, voles, rats) and insectivores (shrews, hedgehogs) are the most common animal reservoirs of borrelia, while larger animals (deer, livestock) serve as hosts for the tick vectors. hares and birds may also serve as reservoirs. ticks by trans-stadial transmission; transovarial transmission in ticks is limited.

ecological characteristics of the ticks influence the epidemiology of tick-borne rickettsioses. in 1910, the first case of mediterranean spotted fever (msf) r. conorii was considered to be the only agent of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses in europe and africa. similarly, r. sibirica was thought to be the only agent in russia and china and r. australis in australia. the reason for this was that diagnosis was made by serologic testing, which cross-reacts with other rickettsial species. due to improved diagnostics, particularly molecular, the understanding of rickettsioses has increased, and new agents are being found regularly. multiple distinct tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses are recognized. the name of the agent informs us where the agent was initially found, but most agents have a more widespread distribution.

blastomycosis is a sporadic disease with a worldwide distribution, though most cases are reported from north america. it is endemic in the mississippi and ohio river basins and around the great lakes. in endemic areas blastomycosis is frequent in dogs but rare in cats and other animals. the annual incidence of blastomycosis in northern wisconsin is estimated to be 40–100 per 100,000 in humans and 1,400 per 100,000 in dogs. in the usa outbreaks are usually seen in the spring and fall, indicating infection 1–3 months earlier. cases are commoner in males and the disease is rare in children. blastomycosis occurs close to rivers and lakes with changing water levels. activities involving shores or waterways, like fishing and canoeing, are identified as risk factors for infection.
two or more doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are necessary for protection. global coverage with three doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are shown elsewhere (see dtp3 map). infants under the age of 3–5 months are, depending on the vaccination schedule, too young to have received two doses and are also vulnerable to complications of pertussis. this group therefore suffers the greatest burden of pertussis mortality. post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic may be recommended for contacts in households where there is a susceptible member (e.g. an infant).
doxycycline for all patients. rifampicin may be useful for hga in younger children and pregnant patients.

since the end of 2003 the a/h5n1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. in 2010 hpai h5n1 remained entrenched in poultry in several asian countries and egypt. while migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of h5n1 (see bird migration map), the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic. hpai h5n1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species, making it an economically important disease. however, it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities. over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries. the concern remains that h5n1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza a virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person.

colorado tick fever is only present in north america (usa and canada). in the usa, besides the states with human cases shown on the map, the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of d. andersoni. the typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry, rocky surfaces. infection is seasonal, coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer. human cases can be detected from march to september in the rocky mountain region, usa. most human cases are males, aged 20–29 years, probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains.
there are two phases, divided into an acute phase (oroya fever) followed after at least 2 weeks by a chronic phase (verruga peruana). verruga peruana may occur without an evident acute phase. oroya fever: fever,myalgia, arthralgia, headache, evolving to severe hemolytic anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly; milder symptoms in children. the cfr for untreated oroya fever is 40–88% and for treated disease is 1–9%. survivors are immune. mortality is associated with secondary infections (e.g. salmonella andtoxoplasma). verruga peruana: there are two phases, divided into an acute phase (oroya fever) followed after at least 2 weeks by a chronic phase (verruga peruana). verruga peruana may occur without an evident acute phase. oroya fever: fever,myalgia, arthralgia, headache, evolving to severe hemolytic anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly; milder symptoms in children. the cfr for untreated oroya fever is 40–88% and for treated disease is 1–9%. survivors are immune.
the precise mechanism is unclear: probably by aerosol spread of nasal secretions from a case to respiratory mucosa of close contacts. m. leprae cannot cross intact skin. the relative risk for leprosy disease in household contacts is 8 to 10 for multibacillary (lepromatous) leprosy and 2 to 4 for paucibacillary (tuberculoid) leprosy.

q fever has been described world wide, with the exception of new zealand. though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries, serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions. most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep. the largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the netherlands between 2007 and 2010, mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms. the outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure. people living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away. the hospitalization rate was relatively high, 20% versus around 5% which is normally reported.
transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae.
pigs; occasionally found in wild boar, horses, dogs, cats, and birds. asymptomatic pigs typically carry the bacteria in their tonsils.

histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) african histoplasmosis. most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. the acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. chest x-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. osteomyelitis is rare. disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with aids and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. it presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, cns and gi tract being the most affected. disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. past infection results in partial protection. reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
via a bite or a scratch by an infected host animal. human infection via s. moniliformis ingestion (milk, water, food) is known as haverhill fever. some streptobacillosis cases may occur by close contact with the oral flora of pet rats through kissing and sharing food. there is no person-toperson transmission.

human infection is associated with cold waters in the northern hemisphere. a 2005 estimate stated that 20 million people were infected world wide. it is common in communities, as in japan, that have a habit of eating raw or undercooked fish. risky fish dishes are sushi, sashimi, south american ceviche, fish carpaccio, salmon tartare, and salted or marinated fillets in scandinavia or baltic region. historically, finland and alaska had a high disease prevalence, but this has decreased due to preventive measures. women seem more at risk, probably due to being involved in meal preparation. the disease incidence is increasing in some countries such as russia, south korea, japan, and brazil. cases are also reported from regions where diphyllobothriasis was expected to have been eliminated, such as alpine lakes in switzerland, northern italy, and eastern france. it is not clear whether the cases reported in hawaii and brazil are autochthonous or from imported fish. d. nihonkaiense, present in japan and far eastern russia, has been reported from a patient who ate raw pacific sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus nerka) from british columbia, canada. d. pacificum (formerly d. arctocephalinum) is increasingly reported as a human parasite along the coast of south america. infected fish can be transported to any part of the world for consumption.
tree-hole-breeding forest mosquitoes: aedes spp. in africa, and haemagogus and sabethes spp. in south america. transovarian transmission occurs in the mosquito and may be the way the virus survives in the years between cycles. the urban vector on both continents is aedes aegypti.

onnv is a mutant of chikv that appeared in 1959 in uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. this large epidemic was remarkable because, in spite of the occurrence of millions of cases, no deaths were reported. it ended without a trace in 1962, reappearing as sporadic cases in africa at rare intervals. in nigeria in 1966 and 1969, cases were described as a new virus, igboora, later recognized as onnv. there was a small outbreak in côte d’ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as igbo-ora virus and a small recurrence in uganda in 1996. serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with chikv antibody. it is not known how or where the virus survives between outbreaks, but sequence data show very little variation between onnv strains isolated in uganda in 1959 and 1996–1997, suggesting that the virus persists, rather than undergoing repeated mutations from chikv (which has a non-human primate reservoir).

an estimated 200,000 yellow fever cases occur annually with 30,000 deaths. the disease is present in the jungles of south america and in the jungles and savannahs of sub-saharan africa. on both continents it is endemic in various species of forest monkey, transmitted among them by mosquito bite. the disease is more common in west africa as compared to east africa. in africa, mainly children acquire infection as older persons have acquired immunity. in south america, yellow fever is mainly an occupational disease of men who work in forests and can carry the infection back home, causing urban epidemics. the yellow fever virus is thought to have originated in africa and to have been carried to the americas in slave ships. due to the relatively recent introduction (about 500 years ago) in the americas, the virus has not yet adapted to the reservoir, explaining why south american monkeys become diseased, but not african monkeys. all countries with urban dengue are at risk of the introduction of yellow fever, including asia and australasia, because the vector is the same (see aedes egypti and aedes albopictus map). why asia has remained free from yellow fever is not understood.

praziquantel; the cure rate for o. viverrini is over 90%.
rmsf and r. parkeri rickettsiosis are characterized by fever, myalgia, malaise, headache, and a maculopapular eruption that can involve the palms or soles. r. parkeri rickettsiosis is milder than rmsf, and often does not require hospitalization. rmsf cases may progress and develop stupor, delirium, ataxia, or coma; rmsf cfr is about 7%. untreated rmsf is often progressive with a cfr of 20%, which is not the case for untreated r. parkeri rickettsiosis. most ( > 90%) r. parkeri cases have an eschar, which is rare in rmsf. gi symptoms are common in rmsf and rare in r. parkeri disease.
flies contribute to the spread of ocular serovars of c. trachomatis.
humans are the natural host. numerous mammals have serologic evidence of hev disease, including but not limited to: pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, macaques, cats, dogs, rabbits, mongoose, deer, wild boar, rats, and mice. hev in pigs is asymptomatic, but there is transient viremia and excretion of virus into the environment.
studies of unvaccinated populations in some western countries indicate that almost everyone will be infected with mumps by adulthood; however the epidemiology of mumps is less well characterized in developing countries. the true number of mumps cases is not known, since it is often a mild disease and reported cases probably represent fewer than 10% of all infections. there is geographic variation in circulating mumps virus genotypes, and there can be several genotypes circulating simultaneously in one area and shifts over time in predominant genotypes. mumps vaccination is recommended at age 12–18 months and is included in the standardimmunization program ofmost developed countries, usually in a trivalent vaccine with measles and rubella (mmr vaccine). a booster dose in later childhood is also recommended for countries with a good immunization program. several developed countries with a well-established mumps vaccination program have experienced significant outbreaks in young adults, who were too old to be included in the childhood immunization schedule and had not been exposed to natural infection due to an overall reduction in the transmission of mumps in the population. other possible reasons for mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations include a waning of vaccine-induced immunity and genotype mismatch between the vaccine strain and the wild virus. since the complications of mumps are more common in affected adults compared to affected children, a shift in the average age of infection can lead to an increase in the number of observed complications. however, despite these issues, it must be remembered that comprehensive mumps vaccination programs are associated with a massive overall decrease in the burden of mumps morbidity.
hbv disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute hbv infection similar to hepatitis a and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear hbv within 6 months. differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and hbv genotype. also co-infection with hdv leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
during blood meal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. the amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. in the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.

clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. a one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate c. tetani infection. since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. tetanus does not induce immunity. vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
gastric anisakidosis: findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed. gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis. intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, peritonitis, ulceration, and bleeding. anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis. pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom.
the disease is distributed worldwide, with the majority cases attributed to contaminated processed foods. listeriosis is, after salmonellosis, the second most frequent cause of food-borne infection-related deaths in europe. the disease incidence has decreased in the usa, while it increased in europe for unknown reasons. the more regular use of immunosuppressive medications and the increasing size of the elderly population has increased the population at risk in both europe and the usa. the majority of invasive listerial infections occurs in individuals with predisposing conditions: pregnancy, corticosteroid use, or other immunosuppressive conditions. one-third of reported cases occur in pregnant women. in non-pregnant patients corticosteroid use is the most important predisposing factor. clinical data from asia, africa, and south america are lacking. l.monocytogenes has been found in food products from these regions. food-borne outbreaks, many of which are manifested by febrile gastroenteritis, have been described with a variety of foods. the most common are processed/delicatessen meats, hot dogs, soft cheeses, smoked seafood, meat spreads, and pates. infections from animal contact are uncommon and generally occur in veterinarians, abattoir workers, and farmers.

humans, generally children with inapparent infections.
jev is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in asia: 35,000 to 50,000 cases are reported annually but this believed to be a significant underestimate of the true disease burden. 20–30% die and 30–50% of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae. it is epidemic in temperate parts of asia, linked to the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes, and endemic in tropical regions of asia due to the year-round mosquito activity. intensification and expansion of irrigated rice production systems in south and southeast asia over the past 20 years have had an important impact on the disease burden caused by japanese encephalitis, since the vectors breed in rice fields. the vectors prefer non-human hosts, but do feed on humans in periods of peak activity. the disease is mainly seen in children under the age of 15 and the elderly, since most adults are immune from earlier infection; peak age is 3–5 years. the range of je virus has recently expanded into the torres strait of northern australia, but the disease is rare in western pacific islands.
tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) virus, an enveloped rna virus with three subtypes: tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) virus, an enveloped
crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host, excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues, usually the lungs. there they encapsulate, mature, and lay eggs. eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed, then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2–4 weeks into miracidia larvae. these penetrate the body of the vector snail, where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish.
the california group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain. each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host, for instance snowshoe hare for sshv. lacv is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the usa. most lacv infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of ae. triseriatusfrom july to september. boys are more often affected with lacv, as they more often play in the woods. jcv is most commonly found around the great lakes in usa and canada. the jcv vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from april to june. sshv, has a different ecosystem: (sub) arctic forests and tundras in canada and siberia. sshv has been detected in china. sshv transmission occurs during the arctic summer from may to august, and mainly affects children (<10 years), especially boys. lumbo virus is a strain of tahv isolated from mosquitoes in mozambique (africa), but no human cases have been diagnosed there.

tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection: ulceroglandular (commonest), glandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, oculoglandular, and typhoidal. clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever, chills, generalized aches, and chronic ulcer at the bite site (ulceroglandular). from the primary site, lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes. further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs. cfr for type a (ulcero) glandular disease is < 2% if treated promptly (5 to 30% if not treated). in the acute septic form (typhoidal) of the disease, lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent, and the cfr is high (30–60%). oculoglandular disease is rare. ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or gi tularemia. in the oropharyngeal form signs are: throat pain, large tonsils, pseudomembrane, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. symptoms in gi tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death. pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria, or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.
noma can be prevented through health education, poverty reduction, improved nutrition, promotion of breastfeeding, proper prenatal care and immunisations against childhood diseases.
in the absence of vaccination, hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to hib by the age of 5. in developed countries (prior to immunization), hib was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in young children, but in countries with high vaccination coverage hib is now almost eliminated as a public health problem. in developing countries hib meningitis is common but hib pneumonia appears to be even more common, with pneumonia morbidity and mortality exceeding that of meningitis. in 2000 hib is estimated to have caused around 8 million cases of severe invasive disease and 360,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. ten countries, all in africa and asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these hib deaths. hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16% of pneumonia deaths in hiv-negative children, therefore hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of sub-saharan africa. global coverage with three doses of hib vaccine was estimated at 28% in 2008, with overall coverage of around 90% in the americas, 65% in europe, 40% in africa, and less than 5% in asia and the pacific. the introduction of hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009, in 83% of who member states (160/193), hib is included in the national immunization schedule.

hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (hps), hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, four corners disease.
it is estimated that over one million cases of scrub typhus occur each year. infections most often occur in rural areas where diagnostic facilities are limited. scrub typhus is thought to occur within the so-called ‘scrub typhus triangle,’ bounded by siberia (north), kamchatka peninsula (east), pakistan (west), and australia (south). o. tsutsugamushi infection primarily occurs in tropical climate in asia, but is also found in temperate zones and semi-arid climates, including in scrub, gardens, forests, beach areas, and mountain deserts. in 2010 the western limit of the orientia genus extended westwards to dubai when a patient was diagnosed with a new orientia species (o. chuto). in southern china, human infections typically occur in the summer and in northern areas the disease occurs mainly during autumn and winter. the migration of infested or infected rodents can lead to the establishment of new foci of disease.
contamination of wounds with soil, dust or animal feces that contain c. tetani spores. puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions. through injection of contaminated street drugs. neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord, either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials.
a generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs. postauricular, occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5–10 days. around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children. arthropathy may occur, especially in young women. the most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (crs), which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy. crs is a severe disease characterized by deafness, cataract, cardiac abnormalities, and a range of neurological impairments.
a protozoan parasite, entamoeba histolytica, that exists in two forms: non-motile cyst and motile trophozoite. e. histolytica needs to be distinguished from the nonpathogenic e. dispar. e. moshkovskii is a common cause of non-invasive diarrhea.
vaccination of children with three doses of hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months, with a booster dose aged 12–15 months. since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive hib disease are at increased risk of disease, rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years.
noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe, mutilating orofacial gangrene, which is painless and usually unilateral. it begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face, including the bone, which may result in severe disfigurement and even death. noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals (noma pudenda).
sudden onset of fever, chills, headaches, body aches, sore throat, vomiting and nausea. bubonic plague is most common, producing swollen, painful and eventually suppurating lymph nodes (buboes) which are usually inguinal. in the septicemic form, y. pestis spreads through the bloodstream usually affecting the lungs, ending in fatal endotoxic shock and dic. the cfr of the bubonic form is 40–70%; of pneumonic and septicemic plague in the absence of prompt treatment, nearly 100%.
intestinal capillariasis is generally found in countries where raw freshwater fish is eaten. the parasite was first reported in 1963 in the northern philippines. c. philippinensisis endemic in the philippines, laos, and thailand. rare cases have been reported from other asian countries and the middle east. a single case has been reported in spain imported from colombia, but there are no other reports of cases in the americas. rare cases of human infection with c. hepatica and c. aerophila have been reportedworldwide. infected fishmay be exported from endemic areas to non-endemic countries.
ebola viruses, except restv, are endemic in the tropical rain forests of equatorial africa. most outbreaks started from a single case admitted to a hospital that had inadequate infection control, resulting in rapid nosocomial transmission. cases have been imported from endemic countries into south africa and switzerland, and laboratory infections have occurred in the uk and russia. marburg viruses are endemic in arid woodlands of equatorial africa. outbreaks are usually limited to a few cases, with the exception of one outbreak in the drc and angola. cases have been imported into south africa, the netherlands, and possibly the usa. a laboratory outbreak in 1967 in germany and in yugoslavia, led to the discovery of the disease (not shown on the map).
the louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics, with a cfr of 30–70%; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease, with a cfr of 2–10%. lbrf has disappeared from europe; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide, except in australia and new zealand, and is rare in europe and north america. human tbrf is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals. otherwise, the disease is sporadic. lbrf is now found sporadically in epidemics in africa, and is associated with refugee camps, natural disasters, and famine. lbrf used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars. it may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations.
endoscopic identification of larvae. eggs and larvae are not found in the feces. specific antibody tests are available for anisakis-associated hypersensitivity.
by animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch (rarely). infected livestock do not bite typically, but may infect a person through their saliva. very rare: licks upon mucosal surfaces; aerosols in bat-infested caves; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation. rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species, for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed.
orov was first isolated in trinidiad in 1955. in south america, cases are limited to trinidad, panama, and the amazon basin. oropouche fever is, after dengue fever, the most common arboviral infection in brazil. the virus has periodically caused large urban epidemics in brazil and peru, during which up to 60% of the population has been affected. there also outbreaks in villages and sporadic cases. approximately 500,000 cases have occurred in brazil since the 1960s. there are three orov genotypes circulating in brazil: genotypes i and ii in the amazon basin and genotype iii in the southeast region. genotype iii has been isolated from a marmoset (callithrix species) in southeastern brazil, and also occurs in panama. outbreaks coincide with periods of highest rainfall, when biting midge density is greatest. orov infections are likely underdiagnosed in south america as was seen during a concurrent outbreak of dengue virus and orov in manus (brazil), where orov infections were missed by physicians and the public health authority.
compatible clinical features, a characteristic mri (pulvinar sign) and the exclusion of other neurological diseases, are usually sufficient to diagnose ‘probable vcjd.’ definitive diagnosis of vcjd is by neuropathological examination of the brain, usually at postmortem.
less than 1% of infections result in acute flaccid paralysis, with around 90% of infections being subclinical. in 10% symptoms may include fever, malaise, headache, neck stiffness, pain in the limbs, nausea, and vomiting. paralysis persists in 0.1–1.0% depending on the virulence of the strain. the flaccid paralysis is usually asymmetric and in one leg. the risk of paralysis is increased by intramuscular injections, immune-compromised state, trauma or surgery (tonsillectomy), and intense physical activity during the incubation period. also adults are at greater risk of developing paralysis than young children. aseptic meningitis occurs in around 1% of infections. more severe paralysis with quadriplegia and breathing problems (bulbar polio) may occur.
brucellosis is a common zoonosis with approximately 500,000 new cases per year world wide. the disease occurs mostly in areas where it is common to consume unpasteurized dairy products (soft cheese) and where poor veterinary health systems exist. the main brucella infecting species vary by region. incidence is highest in males with occupational exposure. the highest incidences are recorded in mediterranean countries, middle east, central america, and central asia. five of 10 countries with highest incidences are in the middle east, with syria leading. many of the high-incidence countries were formerly part of the soviet union. since their independence the veterinary health system has deteriorated, leading to an increase in brucellosis cases. in the usa it is mainly reported in hispanics eating imported infected food. the disease is not considered highly endemic in south america. data from brazil is lacking, despite high cattle densities in this country (see livestock map). many western european countries have brucellosis-free status. mediterannean european countries implemented eradication campaigns, but still a high prevalence exists, especially in the balkan peninsula. in eastern europe the disease is limited to veterinarians.
according to the who leprosy case definition, at least one of the following: (1) hypopigmented or reddish skin lesion(s) with loss of sensation, (2) thickening of the peripheral nerves with loss of sensation, and (3) acid-fast bacilli in skin smear (often negative). histology is the gold standard. m. leprae cannot be cultured in vitro.
microfilariae ingested by the fly develop in about 7 days into infective l3 stages and migrate to the head and escape into the skin during feeding. in the subcutaneous tissues the l3 larvae moult into l4 stages and produce nodules within which they develop in 10 months into adult filariae and can live there for 14–15 years. the female worms can produce microfilariae for 10 years. microfilariae are typically found in the skin, skin lymphatics, and ocular tissues. they have a lifespan of up to 2 years. humans remain infectious for about 10 years, the time the female worm remains fertile, bur reinfection occurs in endemic areas.
fecal–oral route, mainly exposure to food or water contaminated with infectious cysts. direct human-to-human transmission occurs via oral and anal sexual activities.
paracoccidioidomycosis is a chronic progressive systemic mycosis. there are two disease forms: (1) an acute/subacute form in children that mainly involves the reticulo-endothelial system, and (2) a chronic or adult form with a long latent period, that mainly affects men and generally is a pulmonary infection. the disease can disseminate to mucous membranes, skin, and lymph nodes. relapses occur in immune-compromised patients and in those with disseminated disease. cfr can be up to 10%, highest in children with underlying conditions, and lowest in adults.
probably bird–mosquito–bird. mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic reservoir birds. this is followed by an extrinsic cycle of a few days in the mosquito, with subsequent transmission to birds or humans by bite. humans are a dead-end host. there is evidence for vertical (transovarial) transmission in mosquitoes.
supportive, there is no specific treatment
domestic and peridomestic rodent control; disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas; formalin-inactivated htnv vaccines are used in russia, china and korea.
there is strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence for a causal relation between vcjd and the bse agent. in the uk, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to bse-infected bovine material during the bse epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the bse agent entering the human food supply were put into place. most people who have developed vcjd have lived in or visited the uk during this time period. the behavior of the vcjd agent under laboratory conditions is also very like that of bse. there is a strong host genetic component, with certain variants of the prion protein gene being much more susceptible to vcjd
rarely by tick bite.
insect repellent, protective clothing, and insecticiding of vector-breeding sites. mass treatment with ivermectin (see ‘therapy’). in case transmission is interrupted with ivermectin, it can recur if ivermectin mass treatment is stopped prematurely.
spores of bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, encapsulated, non-motile rod. the spores are resistant to desiccation, extremes of temperature and ph, ultraviolet radiation and many disinfectants, and can remain viable for 60 years. it is considered a biological warfare agent.
dengue-like acute febrile illness with sudden onset fever, severe chills, severe headache, eye pain, symmetrical polyarthralgia of all joints (as opposed to dengue, which attacks mainly elbows and knees), generalized myalgia, sometimes dry cough and coryza, leucopenia and often an itching, descending morbilliform rash. marked cervical lymphadenitis distinguishes it from chikungunya infection. hemorrhagic signs have not been seen. recovery is complete, without sequelae.
extracellular, unicellular hemoflagellate trypanosoma brucei, with two subspecies: t. b. gambiensein west and central africa (tropical forest), t. b. rhodesiense in east and southern africa (savannah).
isolation of c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs.
supportive.
female mosquito of the genus anopheles; mainly bites between dusk and dawn (see anopheles map).
sars
the vector becomes infected with orov by feeding on a viremic host. the virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect. after a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding. jungle cycle: orov is transmitted among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds by the mosquitoes aedes serratus and culex quinquefasciatus. urban cycle: orov is transmitted to humans by midges (culicoides paraensis).
mild disease: oral itraconazole or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. for severe cases: iv amphotericin b or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. treatment is long and is monitored by clinical and radiological signs.
sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and can progress with signs of myalgia, photophobia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and congestion of conjunctivae. after 3–4 days there can be a remission phase leading to either recovery or more severe disease with hemorrhagic signs (epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, melena) and hepatorenal syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. cfr in severe cases is 15 to 50%.
humans; forest monkeys in west africa and southeast asia.
microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the kato–katz or rapid sedimentation techniques (rsts) are diagnostic for the chronic infection. serological tests (fas2elisa) is recommended for acute infection. the intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used. radiology, such as computed tomography, can demonstrate liver lesions (only in acute infection) similar to metatastic lesions. for chronic infections, a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites.
search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing. use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing.
fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, and signs of dehydration in severe cases (mainly in young children). in adults the disease is often subclinical. symptoms last for about one week.
piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. humans can remain infected for several decades.
rat–mollusc–rat; humans are incidental dead-end hosts. larvae are excreted with rat feces, ingested by vectormolluscs, in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days. when ingested by a rat, the larvae enter the brain, mature into adults, and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs. there, female worms lay eggs (about 15,000 per day) that hatch into larvae, which in 6–8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx, are swallowed and excreted. when ingested by a human, the third stage larvae also migrate to the cns, but the worm does not mature.
ebola viruses: unknown route. bats have not yet been implicated in the initiation of ebola outbreaks. however, most outbreaks are associated with the consumption or contact with diverse non-human primates, suggesting that transmission could occur from bats to monkeys to humans; exposure to contaminated body fluids; by direct person-toperson contact; via injection with re-used syringes; preparing bodies of cases for burial. marburg viruses: most outbreaks are associated with index cases visiting caves or working in mines. as egyptian fruit bats are cave animals, transmission may occur directly from bats to humans or via contact with their excreta and secreta; transmission between humans is similar as for ebola virus. ‘cuevaviruses’ are probably apathogenic for humans.
single im injection with benzathine penicillin g.
s. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. free-living filariform (l3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. in the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (l1) are excreted. these non-infectious (l1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (l3) larvae. some non-infectious l1 larvae may develop faster into infectious l3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. this process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.
microscopy, isolation of the agent from lesion, blood or pus by inoculation into mouse footpad or guinea pigs, or culture; serum agglutination test; pcr.
dracunculus medinensis, a nematode roundworm. the longest adult female recorded is 80 cm, and adult male 40 cm.
chloroquine is effective; primaquine is likely unnecessary as a gametocidal drug since gametocytes appear to be sensitive to chloroquine.
katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis, caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain. katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals (e.g. travelers) and relatively rare among local residents with exposure since childhood. s. mansoni causes intestinal schistosomiasis with: diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, hepatosplenomegaly. s. haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis with dysuria, hematuria, hemospermia, and dyspareunia. s. intercalatumand s. guineensis: granulomas, rectal polyps and ulcers. chronic infection may lead toliverfibrosis,hepatosplenomegaly, and portal hypertension (s. mansoni), obstructive uropathy, bacterial infection,infertility, and bladder cancer (s. haematobium); rectitis, salpingitis, infertility and abortion (s. intercalatum, s. guineensis); anemia and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children. rarely, cns disease may follow s. haematobium and s. guineensis infection.

c. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions. the organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months. prevention is targeted to those working with livestock, mainly sheep and goats; appropriate disposal of birth products; routine testing of risk animals; restricted movement of animals in infected regions; culling of infected animals; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries; pasteurize milk.
bilharziasis, snail fever, katayama fever or syndrome, intestinal schistosomiasis.
primary: bcg vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease. secondary: intensive search for and treatment of source cases; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis. who has established a ‘stop tb partnership’ program to control tb world wide.
eggs excreted by the mammalian host in the feces into freshwater are ingested by the snail vector. they hatch and in 2 months pass through various stages in the snail to produce motile cercariae, which leave the snail and penetrate freshwater fish. in 6 weeks the cercariae encyst, and when the fish is eaten by another mammalian host, they exit the cyst and penetrate the bile duct, where in a month they mature into adult worms and start to produce eggs.
the nematodes: anisakis simplex, a. physeteris, pseudoterranova decipiens, and contracaecum spp. a. simplex and p. decipiens are the most important species for human disease. anisakis larvae are whitish, tightly coiled, 1.5–2 cm in length, and difficult to see in fish flesh. pseudoterranova larvae are 2–3 cm in length and red to brown in color.
the disease is seasonal, generally coinciding with tick activity; there are peaks of incidence every 5–7 years in china. europe and russia have an estimated 12,000 cases per year (2007). in eastern regions the disease coincides with tick habitat in cold, moist forest, but tick ranges extend well beyond reported disease at both eastern and western geographical extremes. during the past two decades, new endemic foci and an increase in cases have been reported in many european countries, in spite of widespread vaccination of at-risk populations. in 1989, fe virus was isolated from ixodes ovatus ticks and the blood of a febrile patient in yunnan province, southwestern china. the virus may have completely different rodent hosts and tick vectors from those in northern china.
humans and a wide variety of domestic and wild mammals, especially dogs, cats, guinea-pigs, rodents, and opossums.
infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds (dust storms) after heavy rains that advance mold growth, usually late summer or early fall. it is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the usa. incidence in california and arizona appears to have increased since 1991 and again since 2001, probably driven by immigration of non-immunes andwheather conditions that favor dissemination of the fungus. prevalence of infection in northern mexico is reported to be 10–40%. male gender, african-american and filipino race/ethnicity, immunosuppression, diabetes, older age and pregnancy are risk factors for chronic and disseminated disease. infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported.

sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ilev and nriv can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. cvv rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the usa in 1995.
smallpox vaccine is protective, but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic. hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions.
common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in p. vivax than in p. falciparum malaria. recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. p. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
river blindness, onchodermatitis.
by mosquito bite. transfused red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma from infected donors can transmit wnv; transmission has also been reported more rarely through organ transplantation, blood transfusion, and mother-to-child. laboratory infections have occurred from aerosols and percutaneous exposures.
hares, hedgehogs, wild mice, livestock, ostriches. since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially, ticks also serve as reservoirs.
humans and fish-eating mammals.
in 1988, the who launched the global polio eradication initiative (gpei). the americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the who western pacific region in 2000 and europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into europe). the gpei has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (opv) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of opv to all children under 5 years of age during sias; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (afp) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area. to be certified polio-free, three conditions must be met: (1) there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus; (2) disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards; and (3) each country must illustrate the capacity to detect, report, and respond to ‘imported’ polio cases. oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. for this reason, efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination.
leishmania species, protozoa, members of the trypanosomatidae family, order kinetoplastida. leishmania species that cause cl in the old world are: leishmania major, l. tropica, and l. aethiopica. l. killicki is synonymous to l. tropica. l. infantum/chagasi and l. donovani can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. l. chagasi is considered the same species as l. infantum, and are referred to as l. infantum/chagasi.
snail–human–snail. infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). the cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans with water contact. cercariae enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver, where they grow into adult male and female worms that migrate to the abdominal veins, mate, and produce eggs. snails are infectious for up to 3 months, humans for 10 years or more.
loa loa filariasis, loiasis, african eyeworm, calabar swelling
wuchereria bancrofti, brugia malayi, and b. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (w. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (b. malayi).
microscopy (kato-katz method). quantitative fecal egg counts are a marker for worm burden: 2,000 to 4,000 eggs per gram of feces is considered to be moderate infection, and 4,000 eggs is heavy infection.
african bunyamwera viruses known to cause human disease circulate in sub-saharan africa. virus transmission peaks in the rainy season when mosquitoes are abundant. all age groups can be infected, though bunv mainly affects children. bunv is particularly active in the riverine forests in nigeria and car. 100% of adults living in tropical rainforest of the drc are seropositive. neutralizing antibody rates of over 50% for ilev have been found in people in savannah areas of nigeria. lower seroprevalences of ilev are found in rainforests. gerv is endemic in southern african countries. to date, gerv has not been reported to be responsible for any major human disease outbreaks, and is therefore considered of minor public health importance.
symptomatic, there is no specific treatment.
ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes, dogs, and cats or contaminated fomites. there is no person-to-person transmission.
obligate intracellular, pleomorphic bacteria of the family anaplasmataceae, which invade host leukocytes. ehrlichia chaffeensis infects mononuclear phagocytes; e. ewingii and anaplasma phagocytophilum infects neutrophils. e. canis may cause human disease in venezuela. in 2009 an e. murislike organism was discovered in usa. neorickettsia sennetsu causes sennetsu fever.

by mosquito bite.
supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation. there is no specific treatment, but ribavirin may have some effect. monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis before onset of clinical signs.
ribavirin in combination with peg-interferon. response to interferon differs by hcv genotype: there is a more sustained virological response in hcv genotype 2 and 3 infections, as compared to hcv genotype1 and 4. the peg-interferon and ribavarin response can be improved by the combination with oral dna-polymerase and protease inhibitors.
direct fecal–oral transmission and via contaminated surfaces. rotavirus has also been detected in repiratory secretions.
there are an estimated 1,000–3,000 human cases per year, but there is considerable underreporting and underdiagnosis. the last plague pandemic of 1894 started in hong kong establishing many endemic foci world wide. new foci continue to arise, as was seen in algiers, in 2003. warm springs and wet summers have increased the plague prevalence in the great gerbil in kazakhstan. similar climatic conditions may have resulted in past plague pandemics. infection control and antibiotics can decrease plague morbidity and mortality but plague cannot be eradicated as it is widespread in wild rodents. there has been a large shift in case load from asia to africa, with more than 90% of cases occurring in africa. the most common form is bubonic plague, but outbreaks of pneumonic plague still occur. plague is possibly more common in africa as poor rural communities in africa live in close proximity to rodents, which are widely hunted and eaten in plague-endemic areas.
unclear, but likely through inhalation of p. marneffei conidia from the environment; cutaneous inoculation may also occur. there is no human-to-human transmission.
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus (cchfv) is an enveloped, spherical virus with a tripartite, singlestranded, negative sense rna genome, belonging to the genus nairovirusin the family bunyaviridae. it has 7 genotypes distinguished by the small (s) segment of the rna.
after ingestion, the virus infects hepatocytes, resulting in periportal necrosis. the virus is shed via bile into the stool and contaminates the environment, leading to new infections in susceptible exposed individuals.
secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole. hiv patients with low cd4 counts should avoid endemic areas.
fever, headache, vomiting, sometimes progressing to acute cns and respiratory involvement, with recurrent seizures in 25% of cns cases. inkv is associated with severe illness and chronic neurologic disease in russia.
sars is thought to have emerged in guangdong province, china, in november 2002 and within 6 months cases were detected in 26 countries, with local transmission occurring in 6. in total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and, remarkably, much of the global transmission of sars can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in hong kong. ‘super spreading’ events (where one person infects an unusually large number of people), such as occurred at the hong kong hotel, appear to be an important feature of sars epidemiology. the precise circumstances and timing of the interspecies transfer of sars-cov remains unknown. many of the early cases in guangdong had epidemiological links to the wild animal trade but later the transmission of sars was exclusively person-to-person with a large nosocomial element. laboratory-accident associated cases in late 2003 and april 2004, and a cluster linked to the wild animal trade in january 2004, highlight the potential for the re-emergence of sars.
human infections occur via two main transmission routes: (1) mosquito bite, and (2) direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (e.g. slaughtering, butchering, veterinary procedures, animal births, disposing of carcasses or fetuses) by percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols. transmissionmay be possible via consumption of raw milk of an infected animal. person-toperson transmission has not been described. however, humans develop high viral loads in the blood, and may transmit virus to contacts.
it is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in africa, and remaining in small foci in central and south america and yemen. onchocerciasis was imported into latin america by the slave trade. onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. this variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
humans and possibly other primates (chimpanzees). evidence of naturally occurring p. ovale in chimpanzees has been reported.
supportive; vitamin a supplementation is important to avoid the complications of vitamin a deficiency resulting from the infection. efficacy of ribavirin is unproven.
prevention of exposure to the wild aquatic bird reservoir and domestic poultry (farm biosecurity). surveillance for infected poultry flocks and culling of infected flocks (stamping out). poultry workers and cullers must wear protective clothing. education of poultry farmers and the general public to reduce high-risk exposures. human cases must be isolated, close contacts monitored, and healthcare workers must wear personal protective equipment.
microscopy for eggs in stool samples; quantification of eggs by kato–katz method; pcr.

supportive with pain management.
fleas, especially the rat flea (xenopsylla cheopis) and possibly human flea (pulex irritans).
rats and other rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the most important zoonotic reservoirs of human infection.
supportive only. human immunoglobulin has been given to pregnant women exposed to rubella and infected with rubella in an attempt to prevent infection or crs, but its efficacy is not proven.
food-borne botulism: intensive supportive care and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv. wound botulism: wound debridement, antibiotics (penicillin) and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv. equine botulinum antitoxin can prevent progression of illness and shorten symptoms in food-borne and wound botulism if administered early. avoid aminoglycoside antibiotics as these may potentiate the toxin and result in a complete neuromuscular blockade and resultant paralysis.

rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure.
common in tropical and subtropical areas world wide among people who go barefoot, endemic between 30 n and 15 s of the equator. mycetoma is endemic in areas with a short rainy season of relatively low rainfall and a temperature range of 30–37 c, followed by a long dry season with low relative humidity temperatures ranging from a night-time low of as little as 15 c to a daytime maximum of up to 60 c. this extreme alteration in weather conditions might be necessary to the survival of the causative organism in its natural niche in soil or plant material. cases have been exported from the endemic region to many nonendemic countries. world wide, about 60% of cases are caused by actinomycetes; the rest are caused by fungi. in africa, eumycetomas are more frequently observed than actinomycetomas; in india, actinomycetes are found in more than half of the cases reported. in south america, 90% of the cases are caused by actinomycetes. infection is most often seen in herdsmen, farmers, and other field laborers. males are 4–5 times more often affected than females, even in areas where both sexes spend a lot of time in the fields. mycetoma is seen in all age groups, but usuallyin adults 20–40 years old. the disease progresses faster in hivpositive and other immunocompromised patients.
during outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. adequate cooking essential; who recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 c, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
anisakidosis occurs world wide, mainly in coastal regions, and in cultures where consumption of raw fish occurs. risky fish dishes are sushi, sashimi, filipino bagoong, salted or smoked herring, gravlax, hawaiian lomi-lomi and palu, south american ceviche, and spanish pickled anchovies. anisakidosis is increasingly common in western european countries and the usa due to the increasing popularity of eating raw fish (usually sashimi). in the usa most cases are related to pacific salmon consumption and in europe to herring consumption. it is unclear why anisakidosis is common in japan, but rarely reported in taiwan or coastal china where similar fish products are eaten. overall there is underdiagnosis of the disease due to the physicians’ inexperience of the disease. pseudoterranovosis (codworm) is relatively more common in north america than in europe or japan. most allergic cases are reported from mediterranean europe. in spain it is mainly related to the consumption of cooked hake and anchovies.
unclear. bamboo rats (rhizomys sinensis, r. pruinosus, r. sumatrensis, and cannomys badius) are natural hosts and the fungus is detected in the soil of their burrows. p. marneffei can survive in sterile soil for several weeks and only a few days in non-sterile soil. p. marneffei has not been recovered from environments not associated with bamboo rats. bamboo rats (except c. badius) eat principally bamboo.

south american blastomycosis, brazilian blastomycosis, lutz–splendore–almeida disease.
the incidence of noma and the prevalence of survivors of noma are not well known. in 1998, who estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection, and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year, of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in sub-saharan africa. an estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year. it occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children, especially in underdeveloped countries. peak incidence is at age 1–4 years, the period of growth retardation in deprived children. the etiology is multifactorial: malnutrition, concurrent infections with malaria or measles, bad oral hygiene, severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors. in developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients, neonates, hiv-positive and diabetic patients.
mosquitoes, primarily aedes and ochlerotatus spp., secondarily anopheles spp. ae. triseriatus (eastern treehole mosquito) is the most important vector of lacv in the usa. lacv is abundant in forests with oak trees (basal holes are important breeding sites) and hickory hardwoods drained by rapid streams. different species of cold-tolerant mosquitoes serve as vectors for jcv and sshv.

personal anti-tick precautions (appropriate clothing, acaricide, repellent). vaccine production ceased in the 1970s and there is no possibility of vector control due to the habitat. screening of bone marrow donors in endemic areas.
by contact with the excretions, or materials contaminated with the excretions, of an infected rodent, such as ingestion of contaminated food or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement. infection can also occur by inhalation of minute particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). person-to-person transmission is rare and known only for machupo virus.
humans.
fluorquinolones are recommended in the absence of resistance. resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole is widespread and resistance to older generation quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins is rising. both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated cases in areas with mdr or nalidixic acid resistance. third-generation cephalosporins is used for severe cases. surgery for abdominal complications (e.g. perforation). dexamethason is recommended for severe cases.
influenza a subtype h5n1, a rna virus, family orthomyxoviridae. avian influenza h5n1 occurs in two forms, a virulent form known as highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 (hpai h5n1) and a milder form known as ‘low pathogenic’ (lpai h5n1). h5n1 viruses have diverged into geographically distinct strains (genetic clades).
the principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity. three clinical forms are recognized. the commonest is generalized tetanus, which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern. on presentation patients commonly have ‘lockjaw’ (trismus), neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal rigidity. generalized spasms may result in an arched posture (opisthotonus). other symptoms include elevated temperature, blood pressure, and sweating. localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound. cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck, and affects cranial nerves.
wild and domestic canines, also skunks, raccoons, mongooses; vampire, frugivorous and insectivorous bats.
taeniosis is t. solium infection of the small intestine and varies from asymptomatic (the most frequent) to weight loss, anorexia and abdominal pain. cysticercosis is a tissue infection with t. solium larvae with findings depending on where cysticerci develop (subcutaneous, eye, heart, cns). its localization in the cns, causing neurocysticercosis, is the most severe form of the disease: seizures, headache, focal neurologic signs, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus may develop. the cfr is low.

by flea bite for the bubonic form, by the respiratory route for the pneumonic form; handling carcasses or eating meat of infected animals. person-to-person transmission occurs through the bite of fleas (bubonic form) or respiratory droplets (pneumonic form).
lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both north america and europe, where its incidence is increasing. incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. the three borrelia species differ in geographic location, vectors, and clinical manifestations: b. burgdorferi ss is present both in north america and europe, but is absent from asia; b. garinii andb. afzelii occur in europe and asia. a recent study showed that b. garinii is the main genotype in china. data of b. burgdorferi presence are lacking for south america, sub-saharan africa, south and southeast asia. in the usa the disease is focal: most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions. in the baltic region, disease rates are several fold higher than in the usa. incidences vary, ranging from 0.3/ 100,000 in the uk to 130/100,000 in austria. climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in lyme disease cases. none of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in australia.
large marsupials, particularly kangaroos and wallabies.
humans; the parasite has also been detected in non-human primates (cynomolgus monkeys, macaques). e. moshkovskii can be found in varying wet environments: clean river sediments, sewage, and brackish coastal pools.
a papule at the bite site develops into a painful chancre (mainly t.b. rhodesiense), with fever, severe headache, lympadenopathy, insomnia and progresses to variable neurological symptoms including a disrupted sleep cycle, confusion, seizures, and, if left untreated, eventually death.
world wide there are approximately 1.5 million new cases of cl per year, with most cases reported from afghanistan, algeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and syria in the old world. the highest burden of cl in the old word is in rural semi-arid and desert regions, but transmission is being increasingly seen in peri-urban and urban environments. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is likely related to the short flight range of sandflies.
supportive and palliative as rabies is almost invariably fatal. heavy sedation with supportive management needs further study (milwaukee protocol). vaccination after onset of rabies confers no benefit.
rift valley fever virus (rvfv), an enveloped, singlestranded tripartite rna virus, belonging to the genus phlebovirus of the family bunyaviridae. there are three lineages: egyptian, west african, and east-central african. zinga virus, isolated in 1982 inmadagascar, was later found to be a strain of rvfv.
principally sylvatic rodents; also marsupials, bats, and shore birds may be involved in the enzootic virus cycle.
a killed vaccine is available for laboratory workers, but is not recommended for use in epidemics. in buildings or rodent burrows, flea control with insecticide should be followed by rat destruction (killing rats liberates fleas); rat control in ports and ships. chemoprophylaxis of pneumonic plague contacts. pneumonic cases should be isolated.
botulinum toxin, produced by the anerobic sporeforming bacterium clostridium botulinum types a, b, e and rarely f. type e and f neurotoxins have been recovered from infants with botulism due to c. butyricum and c. barati. c. botulinum is considered a biological warfare agent.
by mosquito bite. transmission from mother to neonate can occur in the intrapartum period; blood-borne transmission is possible.
acute: hepatomegaly, prolonged fever, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, urticaria, lymphadenopathies, and arthralgias. significant clinical improvement 3–5 days after specific treatment is diagnostic. chronic (which may be asymptomatic and last for more than 10 years): biliary obstruction with upper abdominal pain, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and extrahepatic cholestasis. liver fibrosis may be a complication of the infection.
there are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban. all three cycles exist in africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in south america. the sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes, and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work. the intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of africa, resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements. urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population (mainly aedes aegypti), that subsequently can transmit to other humans.
doxycycline; erythromycin for pregnant women; alternatives are ceftriaxone, norfloxacin and trovofloxacin; in cases of no response: gentamicin; surgery in advanced cases.
fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. cycle: human to human and occasionally animal to human. hev is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. the amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis a (see hepatitis a map).
personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticide of breeding places). there is no vaccine for human use.
humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for 3 to 7 days post illness onset. the virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, after which it can infect another human by bite.
lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
humans are the only known reservoir host.
direct: acid fast smear/culture and pcr of sputum and other body fluids, depending on clinical presentation; serological: tuberculin skin test (mantoux); interferon gamma release assays (igras). culture in liquid media is gold standard and allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing but takes weeks to months; pcr allows for early detection, and recent assays include detection of resistance-associated mutations.

demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; pcr tests have been developed for the different leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. the montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
mosquitoes of more than 40 species, principally of the genus culex, but also anopheles, aedes and others. some vector species can shift their feeding preference from birds to humans, depending on the season (e.g. culex pipiens). the main vectors in the usa are: culex pipiens (eastern), culex tarsalis(midwest andwest), and culex quinquefasciatus(southeast). in europe two populations of culex pipiens exist: one that feeds on birds and the other on humans.
approximately 1 million people are infected with schistosoma spp. in cambodia, china, lao pdr, and the philippines. schistosomiasis has been eliminated from japan and the burden has been greatly reduced in china through extensive control efforts. schistosomiasis is a water-based disease, that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to large irrigation projects or dams. s. japonicum is found in china, philippines, and indonesia. in indonesia, schistosomiasis is confined to two endemic areas in central sulawesi. s. mekongi is found in the mekong river area of cambodia and laos, and has also been detected in thailand. s. malayensis has only been reported from malaysia and is a rare cause of human disease.

bartonellosis due to b. bacilliformis was originally restricted to high, dry mountain valleys from 600 to 3,200 meters in the andes of colombia, ecuador and peru. since 1997 it has expanded geographically to the utcubamba river valley, cusco, la libertad and the low-lying hills below 600 meters in coastal ecuador. the cause for this expansion is unknown. the disease incidence is increasing in peru, particularly in children. in endemic areas attack rates of 12.7/100 person-years are found, with highest rates in children under 5. there is a decreasing incidence with increasing age due to acquired immunity. for each year of age, the risk of infection diminishes by 4%. most cases cluster, with 70% occurring in only 18% of households in the community where the outbreak happens.
cysticerosis has a worldwide distribution, mainly where pigs are consumed and sanitation is substandard (see streptococcus suis map for pig density and sanitation map). in endemic countries it is an important cause of epilepsy, causing a high disease burden in mainly poor families. in several countries neurocysticercosis is the cause of 10–50% of seizures. neurocysticercosis is common in latin america and non-muslim african and asian countries where pig is eaten and traditional pig rearing is practiced. regions with the habit of eating raw or undercooked pig meat are at increased risk. in europe, cysticercosis has largely disappeared due to strong health system and good sanitation. in several developed nations, like the usa and spain, there is an increase in certain regions where lots of migrants live who have come from high endemic countries. tapeworm carriers can cause small outbreaks, as was observed in a jewish community in new york that employed cooks from latin america.

thought to be acquired primarily through ingestion of infected tissue from cattle with bse. iatrogenic transmission has occurred through blood transfusion. to date there have been no known transmissions of vcjd by tissue or organ transplantation from infected people, or through contaminated surgical instruments.
the majority of the cases (70–80%) are asymptomatic. sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and upset, nausea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and frequently a maculopapular rash. less than 1% of infected persons develop neuroinvasive disease. neurological disorders are more frequent in the elderly and immunocompromised, and may be fatal, with the exception of the kunjin strain. after 5 years 60% of patients who presented with neuroinvasive disease continued to report weakness, fatigue, memory loss, and ataxia.
bat to bat via unknown route. humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts.
wild birds. over 100 bird species can be infected by wnv infection. many birds get infected and amplify the virus but do not die. the robin is probably the main amplifying host, and rarely has overt disease. american crows, blue jays, and hawks are susceptible to death. the number wnv bird deaths can predict subsequent disease severity in humans and equines.
