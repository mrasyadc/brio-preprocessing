sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, and headache, followed by pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. severe cases have internal and external hemorrhages, cns involvement and multi-organ failure leading to terminal shock. the case fatality rate (cfr) varies, depending on location, virus involved, and clinical care: 0% for restv and tafv, 34% for bdbv; 78% for ebov, 53% for sudv, 82% for marv. recovery may be prolonged and accompanied by long term sequelae, particularly hearing loss. filoviruses can persist for months and disease may recur.

the highest global burden of cl is in the old world. in the americas, bolivia, brazil, and peru have the highest burden of cl. in the new world, cl mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the old world it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. transmision can also occur in deforested areas. disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.

cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and various wildlife species. b. canis in dogs and coyottes.
none.
avoid contact with armadillos or their habitat.
s. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. free-living filariform (l3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. in the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (l1) are excreted. these non-infectious (l1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (l3) larvae. some non-infectious l1 larvae may develop faster into infectious l3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. this process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.

most south and several central american countries between 23 n and 34 s have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions, particularly brazil, colombia, venezuela, and argentina. the prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75% in adults, with active disease developing in approximately 2% of infected individuals. the endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams, mild temperatures, a short winter, and a summer with moderate rain. the disease mainly affects active rural workers (coffee, cotton, and tobacco farmers), probably due to environmental exposure. this explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years. postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form. contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis.
isolation of c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs.

hygiene, access to clean water and sanitation. an oral cholera vaccine is available which is safe and provides sustained protection of > 50% that lasts for 2 years in endemic populations. the vaccine does not protect against infections with o139 strains. chemoprophylaxis for contacts may consist of tetracycline or doxycycline. breast-feeding protects infants. quarantine is ineffective. infection results in limited protection against homologous strains, but there is no cross-protection. cholera must be reported to national health authorities as small local outbreaks may become large epidemics.
vaccination of children with three doses of hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months, with a booster dose aged 12–15 months. since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive hib disease are at increased risk of disease, rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years.

avoid eating raw slugs, snails, other molluscs, freshwater prawns, land crabs, and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds (e.g. watercress) from endemic areas.washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination. boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 c for 24 hours.

who recommended regimen (directly observed treatment short-course or dots) is 2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin plus isoniazid. if resistance to rifampicin or isoniazid is suspected, treatment must continue with second-line drugs for at least 18 months. drug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr and xdr-tb) require special regimens. mdr-tb is defined as resistance to two main first-line tb drugs: isoniazid and rifampicin. xdr-tb (extensive drug resistant tb) is defined as mdr-tb with resistance to fluoroquinolones and one second-line injectable drug.
tabanid and stomoxys flies and mosquitoes can transmit, but are not epizootic vectors. blow-flies can also spread the bacteria.
c. botulinum spores are found in soil, dust, honey, marine sediments, and in intestines of fish and land animals.
the vector becomes infected with orov by feeding on a viremic host. the virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect. after a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding. jungle cycle: orov is transmitted among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds by the mosquitoes aedes serratus and culex quinquefasciatus. urban cycle: orov is transmitted to humans by midges (culicoides paraensis).
infections are often mild, with more severe neurologic disease in 4–14% of the cases that may progress to death. veev infection often presents like an influenza-like illness. severe encephalitis is less common in adults as compared to children. absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and mayaro fevers. about 30% of survivors have neurological sequelae. cfr for vee is <1%. veev infection may cause stillbirths.

rat–mollusc–rat; humans are incidental dead-end hosts. larvae are excreted with rat feces, ingested by vectormolluscs, in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days. when ingested by a rat, the larvae enter the brain, mature into adults, and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs. there, female worms lay eggs (about 15,000 per day) that hatch into larvae, which in 6–8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx, are swallowed and excreted. when ingested by a human, the third stage larvae also migrate to the cns, but the worm does not mature.

by mosquito bite. there is no direct person-toperson transmission.
crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host, excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues, usually the lungs. there they encapsulate, mature, and lay eggs. eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed, then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2–4 weeks into miracidia larvae. these penetrate the body of the vector snail, where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish.
microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. in humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
