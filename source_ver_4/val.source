barmah forest virus (bfv) and ross river virus (rrv), enveloped rna viruses, genus alphavirus in the family togaviridae. an early isolate of bf from queensland was initially named murweh virus. there are two topotypes of ross river virus, from eastern and western australia; a third, in northeastern australia, has not been found since the mid-1970s.
ebola viruses: unknown route. bats have not yet been implicated in the initiation of ebola outbreaks. however, most outbreaks are associated with the consumption or contact with diverse non-human primates, suggesting that transmission could occur from bats to monkeys to humans; exposure to contaminated body fluids; by direct person-toperson contact; via injection with re-used syringes; preparing bodies of cases for burial. marburg viruses: most outbreaks are associated with index cases visiting caves or working in mines. as egyptian fruit bats are cave animals, transmission may occur directly from bats to humans or via contact with their excreta and secreta; transmission between humans is similar as for ebola virus. ‘cuevaviruses’ are probably apathogenic for humans.
by tick bites, except for n. sennetsu, which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts. no person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion.
contamination of wounds with soil, dust or animal feces that contain c. tetani spores. puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions. through injection of contaminated street drugs. neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord, either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials.
hib is transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.
during outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. adequate cooking essential; who recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 c, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
colorado tick fever virus (ctfv), a prototype virus of the genus coltivirus of the family reoviridae; a spherical, enveloped virus with a double-stranded rna genome of 12 segments.
mosquitoes of the genera aedes, culex, mansonia and others. there is transovarian transmission of rvfv in mosquitoes. dried mosquito eggs can remain viable and infected for years. originally, the eggs are laid in the damp soil above the water line and hatch when flooded.
none.
snails, slugs, and land planarians. the giant african snail, achatina fulica, is the major source of infection world wide; but has been replaced by the imported south american golden apple snail, pomacea canaliculata, in taiwan and mainland china.
blood culture with prolonged incubation (42 days); lysis centrifugation blood culture systems or subculture of blood culture bottles onto fresh chocolate agar enhances sensitivity. several serological assays are available (cft, elisa, ifa), but cross-reactivity occurs; pcr on blood and tissue.
about 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
none.
eggs develop in water in 3–7 weeks, hatch producing miracidia which enter the intermediate snail hosts, in which they develop into cercariae. the cercariae encyst on water plants and develop to metacercariae. when ingested, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, where the flukes attach to the mucosa of the small intestine, mature, and start egg production in 2 to 3 months.
veldt sore (cutaneous diphtheria).
a combination of several arvs is recommended, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections, general measures to maintain nutrition and health, and treatment of specific infections or hiv-associated disorders.

unknown. it has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
supportive.
contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes; drinking contaminated water (less common).
ancylostomiasis, necatoriasis, uncinariasis, ground itch.
unclear. bamboo rats (rhizomys sinensis, r. pruinosus, r. sumatrensis, and cannomys badius) are natural hosts and the fungus is detected in the soil of their burrows. p. marneffei can survive in sterile soil for several weeks and only a few days in non-sterile soil. p. marneffei has not been recovered from environments not associated with bamboo rats. bamboo rats (except c. badius) eat principally bamboo.

igg and igm antibody detection to phase i and ii antigens by ifa, cft, or elisa; immunohistology; pcr; ultrasound for endocarditis.
none.
the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host. the virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito. after several days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
mebendazole or albendazole; radical surgical excision.
echinococcus multilocularis, a small (3–6 mm long) cyclophyllid cestode (tapeworm).
cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis

north american blastomycosis, gilchrist disease
supportive; there is no specific therapy.
surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye. diethylcarbamazine (dec) is filaricidal but can cause saes in patients with heavy infection. saes can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids. alternative: albendazole with a lower risk of saes in case of heavy infection.

various vaccines are available; personal antimosquito precautions; intermittent irrigation of rice fields disrupts vector breeding; vaccination of pigs reduces amplification.
taeniosis is t. solium infection of the small intestine and varies from asymptomatic (the most frequent) to weight loss, anorexia and abdominal pain. cysticercosis is a tissue infection with t. solium larvae with findings depending on where cysticerci develop (subcutaneous, eye, heart, cns). its localization in the cns, causing neurocysticercosis, is the most severe form of the disease: seizures, headache, focal neurologic signs, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus may develop. the cfr is low.
in early and limited disease: 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin. for more extensive disease: rifampicin plus streptomycin for 8 weeks; extensive lesions may require reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy. lesions < 5cm can be excised under local anesthetic.
virus detection in the blood by rt-pcr or virus isolation; igm elisa is available, cross-reactivity may occur with other flaviviruses.
two or more doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are necessary for protection. global coverage with three doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are shown elsewhere (see dtp3 map). infants under the age of 3–5 months are, depending on the vaccination schedule, too young to have received two doses and are also vulnerable to complications of pertussis. this group therefore suffers the greatest burden of pertussis mortality. post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic may be recommended for contacts in households where there is a susceptible member (e.g. an infant).
ebola or marburg hemorrhagic fever.
the estimated prevalence of strongyloidiasis is between 30 and 100 million infections in 70 countries world wide; however, the accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to poor performance of screening methods. most cases are found in tropical and subtropical areas (warm, moist). rarely, it is found in foci in north america and europe. it is of significance in developed nations as it can cause hyperinfection in immunocompromised patients that have been infected years before in an endemic region. the most important risk factor for hyperinfection is corticosteroid therapy; other risk factors are: hematologic malignancies, malnutrition, alcoholism, htlv-1 infection, and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplantation). interestingly, hyperinfection is not commonly seen in hiv-infected individuals in endemic countries.
maduromycosis, madura foot
supportive; intravenous ribavirin and convalescent human serum are recommended.
hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
chloroquine is effective; primaquine is likely unnecessary as a gametocidal drug since gametocytes appear to be sensitive to chloroquine.
praziquantel; the cure rate for o. viverrini is over 90%.
search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing. use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing. there is no effective vaccine.

use closed footwear; thoroughly clean penetrating wounds in endemic areas.
rotavirus diarrhea, acute viral gastroenteritis, severe viral gastroenteritis.
salmonella enterica enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi), a gram-negative bacillus. s. typhi belongs to salmonella serogroup d and possesses somatic antigen o9, a single flagellar antigen hd, and virulence antigen vi. s. paratyphi a can cause similar disease.
rarely reported in the americas and europe, sporadic in parts of southeast asia, especially thailand, china, and vietnam. most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. furthermore, in several asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. since s. suis is often misidentified, s. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
personal anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine for wee.
humans.
by mosquito bite. experiments demonstrated human to human transmission with the mosquito as vector, but there is no direct human-to-human transmission.
anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine available.
enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
mosquitoes. the main vector of enzootic veev is the culex (melanoconion) spp. (spissipes group). during veev outbreaks, ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions. epizootic/epidemic subtypes of veev are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera.
serology is mainly used (immunodiffusion and cf tests). detection of antigen in blood, csf, urine or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by radioimmunoassay. microscopy on giemsa stained bone-marrow or blood smear. histoplasma skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed. pcr-based tests are available. fungal culture is generally slow.
amphotericin b desoxycholate and/or azole antifungals; surgery to remove foci.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria, or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers. direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases. people recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks. rarely from contaminated items. in the past, outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk.
hard ticks, principally ixodes scapularis (formerly i. dammini) and i. pacificus in north america, i. persulcatus and i. ricinus in eurasia. in russia, the principal vectors are i. persulcatus in the west and i. ricinus in the east.
hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite rna genome, that belong to the bunyaviridae family. hantaviruses are named after the hantan river area in south korea, where the first hantavirus (hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. old world and new world hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. old world hantaviruses shown on the map are: dobrava–belgrade virus (dobv), hantaan virus (htnv), puumula virus (puuv), and saaremaa virus (saav). seoul virus (seov) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
majority will be asymptomatic in the acute phase, but approximately 80% develops chronic hcv disease. acute disease: insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, nausea, malaise and vomiting; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine. most infected cases (approx. 80%) develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom; 20–30% even-tually develop severe liver disease: cirrhosis and liver cancer (may take 20 years and is dependent on the presence of other risk factors). hcv infection is an important cause for liver transplantation in developed countries. there is accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of hepato-cellular carcinoma in: men, elderly, obese, alcoholics, those infected with hiv or hepatitis b virus.
early lyme disease is generally treated for 10–14 days, late lyme disease for 21–30 days. oral antibiotics commonly used are: doxycycline or amoxicillin. patients with neurological or cardiac forms of illness may need iv ceftriaxone or penicillin.
dengue-like fever with headache, malaise, arthralgia or myalgia for about 2 to 5 days; occasionally nausea and vomiting, lower limb weakness, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a rash. the fever resolves in a few days; the disease is non-fatal.
several serologic tests are available. virus can be isolated or rna detected in acute blood by rt-pcr.
lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease that can affect the skin, heart, nervous system and, less commonly, the eyes, kidneys, and liver. often there is an annular skin rash that develops at the bite site, known as em. after several months, approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection will have intermittent arthritis. up to 5% of untreated patients develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection. re-infection can occur.
o. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. o. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.
wear clothes that cover extremities; cover skin lesions; insect repellent; cover water supply.
fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, and signs of dehydration in severe cases (mainly in young children). in adults the disease is often subclinical. symptoms last for about one week.
repeated direct contact with infected secretions from infected individual (mainly from eye to nose); also by hands and fomites (shared clothes, towels, or bedlinen). flies also play a role in the transmission. high risk of infection in close contacts of infected individuals.
infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. onset is often insidious. common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. cough may be prominent. symptoms can come and go. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. hiv-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis (cl): espundia, uta, chiclero ulcer, forest yaws.
in 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new s. typhi cases and 216,500 deaths, with large regional variability. these estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease. typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in south central and southeast asia and south africa. two seasonality patterns are observed: (1) higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water, and (2) higher incidence in the rainy season, due to spillover from sewage to drinking water. declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved, mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation (see water and sanitation map).
coxiellosis, query fever.
undetermined. thought to be forest rodents (squirrels, rats, mice, dormice), shrews and monkeys in the rainforests of west and central africa.
angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode lungworm of rats. adult worms are 17 to 25 mm long. angiostrongylus costaricensis is the causal agent of abdominal, or intestinal, angiostrongyliasis and is not shown on the map. other pathogens, like gnathostoma spinigerum, are able to cause eosinophilic meningitis, but are not shown on the map.
soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. unlike bats, birds are not infected by h. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
humans.
the mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. the infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. o. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
the multi-mammate rat (mastomys natalensis), which lives in houses and surrounding fields. previous studies that identified m. erythroleucus and m. huberti as reservoirs may have confused the species. m. natalensis is generally absent in coastal west africa.
none.

sindbis virus (sinv), a single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped rna alphavirus, with 5 genotypes: sin i (european/african), sin ii and iii (asian/australian), sin iv (azerbaijan/china), and sin v (new zealand). the first sindbis virus isolated was cultured in 1952 from a mosquito near sindbis village in the nile delta (egypt). almost 10 years later the first human case was detected in uganda in 1961 and in europe in 1971.
human–copepod–human. adult female worm expels larvae through a hole in the skin of the leg or foot of an infected person into stagnant water where they are ingested by the vectors. the larvae become infectious in 2 weeks and when the vectors are ingested and digested, the larvae are freed and migrate into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and thorax. there they mature into adults. larvae are shed for 2–3 weeks, are viable in water for up to 5 days, and develop in the copepod for 2 weeks.
detection of trypanosomes in blood, lymph, or csf after concentration; igm elisa, ifa, pcr. a card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (catt) is available for t. b. gambiense but not t. b. rhodesiense.

consumption, white plague, tb.
animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
larval stage mites, so-called chiggers from the genus leptotrombidium. a number of small rodents, particularly wild rats, are the natural hosts for scrub typhus without apparent disease.
mosquitoes (aedes and culex spp.).
supportive, there is no specific treatment. ribavirin may limit the severity and improve the prognosis of lacv infections. anticonvulsant medication in those with seizures.
principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
human-deer-fly-human. after infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. in the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. an infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
