often misidentified as p. malariae, but skilled microscopists are able to make the distinction. a relatively severe illness with a microscopic diagnosis of p. malariae should alert clinicians to the possibility of p. knowlesi because p. malariae malaria is almost invariably mild. species can be confirmed by pcr if needed.
tick–vertebrate–tick, with humans as incidental hosts.
fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. there they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. when the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. in some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.

painless cutaneous lesions appear at the site of sandfly bite and typically these develop into ulcers with a raised border. occasionally nodular and rarely verrucous lesions. multiple lesions and regional lymphadenopathy may be present. lesions may resolve spontaneously or remain for several months to years. rarely dissemination to mucosa occurs of the upper respiratory tract with local tissue destruction leading to disfigurement (most often by l. braziliensis, known as espundia), with risk of severe and sometimes fatal secondary infections.
the fungus grows as a mycelium in the environment and in human or animal tissue it converts into a budding yeast.
loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases. typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings (calabar swellings) which are angiedemas. these swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs, especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement. less frequently: giant urticaria, arthritis, and fever. the adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye. encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis. these saes mainly occur in those with heavy infection ( > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood).

noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe, mutilating orofacial gangrene, which is painless and usually unilateral. it begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face, including the bone, which may result in severe disfigurement and even death. noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals (noma pudenda).
rmsf and r. parkeri rickettsiosis are characterized by fever, myalgia, malaise, headache, and a maculopapular eruption that can involve the palms or soles. r. parkeri rickettsiosis is milder than rmsf, and often does not require hospitalization. rmsf cases may progress and develop stupor, delirium, ataxia, or coma; rmsf cfr is about 7%. untreated rmsf is often progressive with a cfr of 20%, which is not the case for untreated r. parkeri rickettsiosis. most ( > 90%) r. parkeri cases have an eschar, which is rare in rmsf. gi symptoms are common in rmsf and rare in r. parkeri disease.
the majority of infections are subclinical ( 95%). those with disease have mild fever, maculopapular rash often involving the palms and soles, which may be hemorrhagic and may recur, polyarthritis of both large and small joints, occasionally swollen extremities, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy. the disease is more severe in scandinavia and south africa than elsewhere. the disease is non-fatal, but moderate residual pain and stiffness in the joints may persist for years.

by mosquito bite.
for c. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
pulmonary distomiasis, lung fluke disease
demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; pcr tests have been developed for the different leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. the montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations. humans and lizards are dead-end hosts.
two interacting cycles can be distinguished: (1) a persistent cycle in the aquatic reservoir, and (2) in the human host, leading to amplification through fecal–oral spread.
praziquantel or niclosamide.
most infections produce few or no symptoms. acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. the entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. after a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. group i t. cruzi, rare north of the amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. group iit. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. aids patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. cfr from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.

(leishmania) amazonensis, l. (viannia) panamensis, l. (viannia) guyanensis (forest yaws), and l. (viannia) peruviana (uta). l. infantum/ chagasi can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. l. chagasi is considered to be the same species as l. infantum, and will be referred to as l. infantum/chagasi.
avoid consumption of inadequately cooked marine fish. clean the fish early after they are caught as larvae migrate from viscera into fish flesh after death. freezing at 20 c for at least 7 days kills larvae. larvae can survive 50 days in vinegar. for allergic patients: avoid food that may contain allergen.

smallpox vaccine is protective, but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic. hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions.
through contamination of penetrating wounds (e.g. by thorns, splinters). there is no person-to-person transmission.
culiseta melanura: bird to bird; aedes or coquillettidia spp.: from bird to other vertebrates (including horses and humans). viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds, and the extrinsic cycle in mosquitoes lasts 2–3 days. horses and humans are dead-end hosts because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
serology (igm elisa, ifa of erythrocytes). diagnosis is confirmed by a significant ( > 4-fold) change in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. virus isolation or rna detection by rt-pcr from the blood or csf.
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus (cchfv) is an enveloped, spherical virus with a tripartite, singlestranded, negative sense rna genome, belonging to the genus nairovirusin the family bunyaviridae. it has 7 genotypes distinguished by the small (s) segment of the rna.
streptomycin is recommended, with gentamicin as an alternative. tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases.
as mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread, control is not feasible; personal anti-mosquito measures; eliminating potential breeding sites (e.g. old tires) and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete.
avoid areas with mites; mite bite prevention by impregnating clothes with miticides; mite elimination in highrisk areas; no effective vaccine is available.
hard ticks, principally hyalomma spp., also boophilus spp. and rhipicephalus spp.
microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the kato–katz or rapid sedimentation techniques (rsts) are diagnostic for the chronic infection. serological tests (fas2elisa) is recommended for acute infection. the intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used. radiology, such as computed tomography, can demonstrate liver lesions (only in acute infection) similar to metatastic lesions. for chronic infections, a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites.
large trematode liver flukes living in blile ducts: fasciola hepatica and fasciola gigantica. f. hepatica is 20 to 30 mm long and f. gigantica can be up to 75 mm long.
immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. cycle: human to human and occasionally animal to human. hev is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. the amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis a (see hepatitis a map).
since the virus has a jungle cycle, environmental insecticide spraying is not feasible; routine personal anti-mosquito measures are indicated.
clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. a one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate c. tetani infection. since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. tetanus does not induce immunity. vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
q fever has been described world wide, with the exception of new zealand. though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries, serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions. most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep. the largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the netherlands between 2007 and 2010, mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms. the outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure. people living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away. the hospitalization rate was relatively high, 20% versus around 5% which is normally reported.

p. ovale initally was thought to be limited to sub-saharan africa, papua new guinea, eastern indonesia, and the philippines. it is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the middle east, the indian subcontinent, and various parts of southeast asia. p. ovale has not yet been reported in south america. in general, p. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in west africa prevalences above 10% are observed. also, infections are most common in children <10 years. there is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, p. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
the natural reservoir is unclear. the fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (dasypus novemcinctus). the disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. as armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. by using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of p. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing. use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing.
by bite of the female sandfly (usually at dusk and at sundown, often indoors); rarely by blood transfusion or transplacental. there is no direct person-to-person transmission.

symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder: fever, headache, myalgia, backache, lymphadenopathy (not seen in smallpox), malaise, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body; the lesions eventually crust and fall off. the outcome can be fatal (cfr: 1–10%).
need to treat both p. ovale blood and liver stage with chloroquine (blood stage) and primaquine (liver stage).
none.
mosquito-host-mosquito. the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host. depending on ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days.
probably bird–mosquito–bird. mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic reservoir birds. this is followed by an extrinsic cycle of a few days in the mosquito, with subsequent transmission to birds or humans by bite. humans are a dead-end host. there is evidence for vertical (transovarial) transmission in mosquitoes.
recovery of s. pneumoniae from sputum, blood, csf or other normally sterile fluids by culture or pcr. s. pneumoniae antigen test in urine.
hendra virus and nipah virus are negative-stranded rna viruses, and comprise the henipavirus genus within the family paramyxoviridae. hendra virus was discovered in horses and stable staff in australia in 1994, nipah virus in pigs and pig farmers in the town nipah, malaysia, in 1999.
via tick bite. or consumption of raw milk or dairy products from infected animals. for eur, rarely, by blood transfusion and breast milk.
serology (igm and igg elisa) on acute and convalescent sera; cross-reactivity exists leading to misidentification. rt-pcr has been used to test human brain tissue samples.
mainly humans. in southeast asia, monkeys, wild carnivores, dogs, and cats may also be infected with b. malayi. w. bancrofti has no known reservoir host.
none.
intravenous, intramuscular, and intralesional application of pentavalent antimonials; also miltefosine is being tested for its efficacy. topical treatment options are: paramomycin, ketoconazole, and thermotherapy.
enterotoxin-producing vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 bengal. serogroup 01 has two biotypes, classical and el tor, each with three serotypes: inaba, ogawa, and the rarer hikojima.
wuchereria bancrofti, brugia malayi, and b. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (w. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (b. malayi).
acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting. usually does not last longer than 2 weeks.
probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in panama and french guiana, also in the usa from a north-bound migratory bird. antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
by mosquito bite. there is no direct person-toperson transmission.
none.
the principle vector is the human body louse (pediculus humanus corporis), which lives in clothes. b. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas.
microscopy of sputum smear or material from lesions can show characteristic budding forms of the fungus; culture; serology is not routinely used.
eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail, where they develop to cercariae that encyst on aquatic plants (e.g. watercress) and become desiccation resistant metacercariae. after the plants are eaten by herbivores (e.g. sheep, cattle), or water containing metacercariae is drunk, the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, enter the liver, and lay eggs in the bile duct, which are then excreted in the feces. the whole cycle takes 3 to 4 months.
self-limiting conjunctivitis, including watery or mucopurulent discharge. typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy. repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis. trichiasis damages the corneal surface, resulting in keratitis, vascularization of the cornea, and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection. corneal damage produces corneal scar, leading to blindness.
mosquitoes: culex and culiseta spp. between birds, aedes spp. from bird to human.
ticks introduce babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. the sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. the gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
hepatitis c virus (hcv) is an enveloped rna virus (hepacavirus) and belongs to theflaviviruses. the hcv genome is highly mutable. there are at least six hcv genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation, geographic distribution and treatment response. hcv was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis (non-a non-b hepatitis).
south american blastomycosis, brazilian blastomycosis, lutz–splendore–almeida disease.
serology (igm elisa, western blot, strip immunoblot, ifa); rt-pcr of biopsy material.
non-invasive gi listeriosis: fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. invasive listeriosis: septicemia, meningoencephalitis, and perinatal listeriosis. meningoencephalitis: headache, stiff neck (often absent), confusion, convulsions and coma (cfr: 20–30%). infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and infection of the newborn. pregnant womenmost commonly haveflu-likesymptoms. focalinfections in any organ may occur. focal cutaneous and eye infections can occur after direct inoculation with contaminated tissue, usually occupational. listerial gastroenteritis is uncommon.
monkeypox virus (mpv), a double-stranded dna virus of the genus orthopoxvirus, family poxviridae. two clades of monkeypox viruses are known: the west african virus and the congo basin virus. the congo basin strain is more virulent than the west african strain. the mpv genome is > 96% identical to the variola virus genome. however, mpv is not a direct ancestor or descendent of variola virus.
ticks of the genera amblyomma and ixodes.
histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) african histoplasmosis. most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. the acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. chest x-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. osteomyelitis is rare. disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with aids and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. it presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, cns and gi tract being the most affected. disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. past infection results in partial protection. reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
pigs and humans are definitive hosts; less often dogs.
from asymptomatic to fatal. acute febrile illness with chills, headache, severe myalgia (with mild rhabdomyolysis), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. less common findings are hepatomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, and aseptic meningo-encephalitis. pulmonary symptoms may occur varying from cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, to adult respiratory distress syndrome. weil disease is a severe form of leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and hemorrhage with a cfr of 5–20%.
igm elisa; igg cross-reacts with other alphaviruses. confirmation needed by neutralization test, virus isolation, or a significant rise in specific antibody between acute and convalescent serum samples; rt-pcr.
