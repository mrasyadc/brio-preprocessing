personal anti-mosquito precautions
humans.
by mosquito bite.
anti-mosquito precautions

acute disease: insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, nausea, malaise and vomiting; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine. most infected cases (approx. 80%) develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom
