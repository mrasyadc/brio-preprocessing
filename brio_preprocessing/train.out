In 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC.

The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae.

Parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. Infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis. Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. In 2005–2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy.

WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America.

Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006–2007 (14.5 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs (native ground squirrels) either at a child-care center or from pet stores.
