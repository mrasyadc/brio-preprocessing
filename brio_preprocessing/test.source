Mycobacterium leprae, a slow-growing, acid-fast, intracellular bacterium. It grows best at 27–30 C, which explains the main target organs of M. leprae: skin, peripheral nerves, nasal mucosa, upper respiratory tract, and eyes.
Lagomorphs and rodents (ground squirrels) for F. tularensis (Types A and B) in North America. Aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in North America, hares and small rodents in northern Eurasia, for F. holarctica (Type B). The bacterium can persist in water.
Direct fecal–oral transmission and via contaminated surfaces. Rotavirus has also been detected in repiratory secretions.
Human–copepod–human. Adult female worm expels larvae through a hole in the skin of the leg or foot of an infected person into stagnant water where they are ingested by the vectors. The larvae become infectious in 2 weeks and when the vectors are ingested and digested, the larvae are freed and migrate into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and thorax. There they mature into adults. Larvae are shed for 2–3 weeks, are viable in water for up to 5 days, and develop in the copepod for 2 weeks.
Primary infection: 1–4 weeks; chronic/ disseminated form of disease may be months to years.
Maduromycosis, Madura foot
Most infections are asymptomatic or mild. Symptoms are: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss, rarely anemia. Massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. Migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis. Proglottids can be seen in the stool.
Q Fever
Primary HIV infection is usually a nonspecific illness with fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and a sore throat. Generalized lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash may occur. Following primary infection there is a prolonged asymptomatic period before the appearance of the clinical manifestations of a loss of immune control over infectious pathogens and cancers. Common presenting AIDS defining illnesses are tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, recurrent bacterial infections, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, and CMV disease.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Adulticide spraying is practiced in areas where horse cases appear. A human vaccine against only the North American strain is available for laboratory personnel.
Rubella virus, a single-stranded RNA positive-sense rubivirus of the family Togaviridae.
The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Initially identified as a single species,B. burgdorferi has been separatedinto at least 12 species. Almost all cases of Lyme disease are caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii, and very few by B. spielmanii and B. lusitaniae.
ICD-9 042-044; ICD-10 B20-24
Neisseria meningitidis, a Gram-negative aerobic diplococcus. Pathogenic N. meningitidis produce a polysaccharide capsule, used for serogrouping. Five serogroups are responsible for most cases: A, B, C, W135, and Y.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Freshwater snails (Bithynia spp.).
Wildlife–tick–wildlife. The tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. The virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. Trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
IgM capture ELISA; NS1 antigen test; RTPCR of blood or tissue; virus isolation in mosquitoes or mosquito cell culture with identification by IFA.
Polyarthritis and rash, epidemic polyarthritis, Barmah Forest virus disease, and Ross River virus disease, Murweh virus disease.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a single stranded RNA virus, genus Hepatovirus in the family Picornaviridae.
Rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
The majority of the cases (70–80%) are asymptomatic. Sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and upset, nausea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and frequently a maculopapular rash. Less than 1% of infected persons develop neuroinvasive disease. Neurological disorders are more frequent in the elderly and immunocompromised, and may be fatal, with the exception of the Kunjin strain. After 5 years 60% of patients who presented with neuroinvasive disease continued to report weakness, fatigue, memory loss, and ataxia.
ICD-9 99.2; ICD-10 A58
Acute: hepatomegaly, prolonged fever, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, urticaria, lymphadenopathies, and arthralgias. Significant clinical improvement 3–5 days after specific treatment is diagnostic. Chronic (which may be asymptomatic and last for more than 10 years): biliary obstruction with upper abdominal pain, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and extrahepatic cholestasis. Liver fibrosis may be a complication of the infection.
Freshwater operculate snails (mainly Parafossarulus sp. and Bithynia sp.).
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
Intraerythrocytic, protozoan parasites, Babesia spp.: B. microti in North America, B. duncani on the west coast of the USA and B. divergens-like in four states; B. divergens in Cape Verde, western Europe, and Finland; B. venatorum in Switzerland, Italy, and Austria; B. microti-like in Taiwan and Japan; Babesia strain KO1 in South Korea. Species are uncertain in China, Egypt, India, and South Africa.
Studies of unvaccinated populations in some western countries indicate that almost everyone will be infected with mumps by adulthood; however the epidemiology of mumps is less well characterized in developing countries. The true number of mumps cases is not known, since it is often a mild disease and reported cases probably represent fewer than 10% of all infections. There is geographic variation in circulating mumps virus genotypes, and there can be several genotypes circulating simultaneously in one area and shifts over time in predominant genotypes. Mumps vaccination is recommended at age 12–18 months and is included in the standardimmunization program ofmost developed countries, usually in a trivalent vaccine with measles and rubella (MMR vaccine). A booster dose in later childhood is also recommended for countries with a good immunization program. Several developed countries with a well-established mumps vaccination program have experienced significant outbreaks in young adults, who were too old to be included in the childhood immunization schedule and had not been exposed to natural infection due to an overall reduction in the transmission of mumps in the population. Other possible reasons for mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations include a waning of vaccine-induced immunity and genotype mismatch between the vaccine strain and the wild virus. Since the complications of mumps are more common in affected adults compared to affected children, a shift in the average age of infection can lead to an increase in the number of observed complications. However, despite these issues, it must be remembered that comprehensive mumps vaccination programs are associated with a massive overall decrease in the burden of mumps morbidity.
Rare, but good disease burden data are lacking. Underdiagnosis is common. There are four main types of botulism: intestinal/infant, food-borne, wound and inadvertent. Infant botulism is the most common form of botulism in the USA and is caused by growth of spores germinating the immature gut of infants and releasing the toxin, or rarely in adults with abnormal intestinal tracts. Honey is a common source, but in 85% of infants, the source is unknown. Infant cases occur from 6 days to 12 months of age and affect equally both sexes. Food-borne botulism is the result of eating fermented, salted, or smoked fish, seafood or meat that has not been cured for long enough to eliminate contamination. It is also due to incorrect home canning or bottling of vegetables or fruit. Botulism usually occurs in outbreaks in those exposed to the same food. The largest numer of reported cases per country over the decade 2000–2009 in ProMED mail have occurred in Thailand (83 cases from deer meat, 163 from bamboo shoots), Poland (276 from preserved food), and Georgia (217 from home-preserved – vegetables). Food-borne botulism outbreaks occur in indigenous tribes in Alaska and Canada by consuming improperly preserved fish products (seal, salmon, salmon eggs). Wound botulism results from failure to remove contaminated soil completely from wounds and sealing them, permitting anaerobic growth of the bacteria. Inadvertent botulism is a recent phenomenon resulting from the use of diluted Botulinum toxin to treat patients for several disorders and for cosmetic reasons.
By tick bite or crushing an infected tick or its feces into a break in the skin or mucous membrane. Also by blood transfusion and, in the laboratory, aerosol.
Mosquito–reservoir animal–mosquito. Humans are dead-end hosts. Equines (horses, mules, and donkeys) are amplifying hosts for the epidemic subtypes of VEEV, with high viremias that can infect a wide range of mosquitoes. Half of infected equids die from VEEV. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds and 3 days in equids. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days.
LBRF: 5–15 days (usually 8); TBRF: 2–18 days (usually 7).
Pestis, pest, bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, black plague, black death.
Humans and possibly other primates (chimpanzees). Evidence of naturally occurring P. ovale in chimpanzees has been reported.
3 days (range 2–9 days).
Cysticercosis
ICD-9 116.1; ICD-10 B41
By mosquito bite.
S. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. Free-living filariform (L3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. In the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (L1) are excreted. These non-infectious (L1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (L3) larvae. Some non-infectious L1 larvae may develop faster into infectious L3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. This process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.
Primary: BCG vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease. Secondary: intensive search for and treatment of source cases; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis. WHO has established a ‘Stop TB Partnership’ program to control TB world wide.
There are only about 5,000 cases of RRV and usually only a few hundred cases of BFV annually. Peak incidence is in the 30–40 year age group, the disease is rare in children. RRV disease is the most common arboviral disease in Aus tralia, accounting for about 90% of cases, often occurring in mixed epidemics with BFV disease on mainland Australia (to which BFV is restricted). Most BFV cases occur in Queensland and are only sporadic. RRV cases have been reported from the island of New Guinea and caused epidemics in Pacific islands in 1979–1980. Transmission occurs year-round, especially in coastal northern and northeastern Australia, but is more intense during the mosquito season in most of the country. Birds are presumed to be involved in spread around Australia; a viremic tourist from Australia is believed to have introduced the eastern topotype of RRV to the Pacific islands. Detailed epidemiological data is available on line at: http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/ source/cda-index.cfm.
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.
Rabies can manifest itself in two general forms: classic encephalitic (furious) rabies and paralytic (dumb) rabies. Both forms are progressive and generally lead to death. The majority of the cases present as encephalitic rabies, with hydrophobia and hyperexcitability. Paralytic rabies presents with flaccid muscle weakness or as febrile encephalopathy. In some papers, a third form, non-classic atypical rabies, is described.
Colorado Tick Fever
Tick bite prevention by avoiding wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, especially in summer months; insect repellents; minimize bare skin check for tick bites and remove them within 24 hours.
Measles virus, a single-stranded RNA negative-sense morbillivirus, family Paramyxoviridae.
Bunyavirus Group C Disease
Streptomycin is recommended, with gentamicin as an alternative. Tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases.
Sudden onset fever, chills, fatigue, transient maculopapular rash constant polyarthralgia/arthritis of small joints (hands, wrists, ankles, feet); leucopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Neurological, cardiac, and hepatic complications rare . The acute stage in infants and young children can be atypical (epidermolysis, myocarditis, or encephalitis), but is rarely fatal. Infected neonates (mother-to-child transmission) are at a high risk of severe encephalopathy and death. Chronic inflammatory joint symptoms were observed in up to 50% of adult cases, and after 2 years in some outbreaks.
Microscopy of sputum smear or material from lesions can show characteristic budding forms of the fungus; culture; serology is not routinely used.
Via tick bite. Or consumption of raw milk or dairy products from infected animals. For EUR, rarely, by blood transfusion and breast milk.
Benznidazole, pentamidine, melarsoprol, eflornithine, suramin, and nifurtimox are effective in acute cases; melarprosol and eflornithine can have SAEs. Patients need to be followed up for 1–2 years.
Typhoid Fever
Eggs excreted by the mammalian host in the feces into freshwater are ingested by the snail vector. They hatch and in 2 months pass through various stages in the snail to produce motile cercariae, which leave the snail and penetrate freshwater fish. In 6 weeks the cercariae encyst, and when the fish is eaten by another mammalian host, they exit the cyst and penetrate the bile duct, where in a month they mature into adult worms and start to produce eggs.
Sanitation to reduce contamination of vector snail habitat, together with mass treatment with praziquantel and health education.
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.8
Oseltamivir may improve survival, if given early after onset. Otherwise treatment is supportive.
Cysticercosis develops after ingesting T. solium eggs; Taeniasis (tapeworm carriage) occurs after ingestion of raw or undercooked pork meat with cysticerci; human to human transmission is by the feco–oral route.
Sudden onset of fever, chills, headaches, body aches, sore throat, vomiting and nausea. Bubonic plague is most common, producing swollen, painful and eventually suppurating lymph nodes (buboes) which are usually inguinal. In the septicemic form, Y. pestis spreads through the bloodstream usually affecting the lungs, ending in fatal endotoxic shock and DIC. The CFR of the bubonic form is 40–70%; of pneumonic and septicemic plague in the absence of prompt treatment, nearly 100%.
Alveolar or multilocular echinococcosis.
Usually 2–7 days.
Principally sylvatic rodents; also marsupials, bats, and shore birds may be involved in the enzootic virus cycle.
Ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals, and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates – these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans. Humans are accidental hosts.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
Cyclops spp., microscopic copepods (crustaceans) commonly known as water fleas.
From asymptomatic to fatal. Acute febrile illness with chills, headache, severe myalgia (with mild rhabdomyolysis), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Less common findings are hepatomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, and aseptic meningo-encephalitis. Pulmonary symptoms may occur varying from cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Weil disease is a severe form of leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and hemorrhage with a CFR of 5–20%.
Human monocytic ehrlichioses (HME), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), Sennetsu fever.
vCJD, mad cow disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, prion disease.
Soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. Blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. Unlike bats, birds are not infected by H. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. Bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
Humans are the main reservoir; non-human primates can be infected, rarely.
Search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing. Use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing.
2–14 days.
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes; drinking contaminated water (uncommon).
Rodent control; those with occupational exposure to rodents (e.g. sewage workers) should wear personal protective clothing; avoid close contact with reservoir animals, including pets; prophylaxis with penicillin or doxycycline following rat bite.
Principally humans; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods, other zooplankton. Crabs, shrimps, and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells.
Visual inspection for adult worm protruding from the skin lesion; microscopic identification of larvae released when lesion is immersed in water.
1–3 weeks.
HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981. As of 2009, over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV. HIV epidemics are categorized into ‘low-level’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population and <5% in vulnerable group such as MSM, injecting drug users, sex workers); ‘concentrated’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population but > 5% in at least one vulnerable group); and ‘generalized’ (HIV prevalence > 1% in the general population). The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa, with 68% of all people living with HIV and 72% of all HIV-related deaths in 2009. The epidemic in Africa is, however, heterogeneous, with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central, East and West Africa, and low-level epidemics in North Africa. No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic. HIV-1 can be divided in four groups (M, O, N, and P). Over 90% of HIV-1 infections are group M and the map opposite shows the distribution of the 9 subtypes (clades) and recombinants of the M group HIV-1 viruses.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus (hepacavirus) and belongs to theflaviviruses. The HCV genome is highly mutable. There are at least six HCV genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation, geographic distribution and treatment response. HCV was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis (non-A non-B hepatitis).
Chagas disease.
Consuming fecally contaminated food or water, raw or undercooked contaminated shellfish. Person-toperson transmission through indirect fecal–oral transmission occurs. The role of bacteriophages needs further elucidation.
The louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics, with a CFR of 30–70%; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease, with a CFR of 2–10%. LBRF has disappeared from Europe; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide, except in Australia and New Zealand, and is rare in Europe and North America. Human TBRF is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals. Otherwise, the disease is sporadic. LBRF is now found sporadically in epidemics in Africa, and is associated with refugee camps, natural disasters, and famine. LBRF used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars. It may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations.
Varies from a week to several months.
Hygiene, access to clean water, and sanitation. An effective vaccine is available; vaccination should be offered to high-risk groups (MSM, liver disease, travelers to endemic areas, IVDUs, outbreaks); passive immunization with immunoglobulins can be given as PEP within 2 weeks of the exposure. The virus remains viable for weeks at room temperature.
Isolation of agent from blood, urine, sputum, pus or skin lesions; direct immunofluorescence; serology. PCR may be of value on samples other than blood.
Thorough cleansing of wounds and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP): rabies-immune globulin and a series of rabies vaccinations. Vaccination of people at high risk (veterinarians, animal rescue personnel, laboratory staff, etc.), avoid contact with stray dogs or cats, sick or dead wildlife; vaccinate all dogs and cats; distribute baits containing oral vaccine in wildlife habitat; quarantine dogs arriving from infected countries. Culling of stray dogs is ineffective; sterilization prevents replacement breeding.
Avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings such as are found in caves. The USA government provides a document, ‘Histoplasmosis: Protecting Workers at Risk’, with information on work practices and personal protective equipment.
Direct person-to-person transmission between close contacts by droplet spread or direct oral contact; through objects contaminated with respiratory secretions.
Streptobacillosis, streptobacillary fever, Haverhill fever, epidemic arthritic erythema, spirillosis, spirillary fever, sodoku.
VIH, SIDA, slim disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.8
Oropouche fever, fevre de Mojui.
Pigs or humans ingest eggs from contaminated environment. Adult tapeworms will only develop in humans after eating raw or undercooked pork containing cysticerci. It takes 2 months for larvae to become an adult worm and produce eggs (up to 300,000 eggs per day). In pigs, eggs invade the general circulation via the intestinal wall and migrate to skeletal and heart muscles where they form cysticerci.
Extracellular, unicellular hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei, with two subspecies: T. b. gambiensein West and Central Africa (tropical forest), T. b. rhodesiense in East and Southern Africa (savannah).

Healthy humans can carry S. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract.
ICD-9 126; ICD-10 B76
Rats are the main host species involved in human rat bite fever for both agents. The main location for S. moniliformis in rats is the pharynx. S. minusis mainly present in the blood and tongue of rats and salivary glands of mice. Other rodent species such as mouse, squirrel, and gerbil – and non-rodent species – have occasionally been identified as possible sources of infection. The rat population is estimated to be 10 billion, which is one-third of the total global mammalian population.
Tsutsugamushi disease, miteborne typhus fever, chigger-borne rickettsioses, coastal fever (Australia).
3–6 days.
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood film; differentiation from P. vivax can be difficult and result in misidentification; parasite load is generally low and may be undetectable by light microscopy; in regions where P. falciparum/P. vivax predominate, P. ovale is frequently overlooked; parasitemia is present for about 2 weeks; PCR.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), North American tick typhus, New World spotted fever, Tick-borne or tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever or ‘febre maculosa’ (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico).
Bunyamwera Viral Fever
Compatible clinical features, a characteristic MRI (pulvinar sign) and the exclusion of other neurological diseases, are usually sufficient to diagnose ‘probable vCJD.’ Definitive diagnosis of vCJD is by neuropathological examination of the brain, usually at postmortem.
Tacaribe Complex Virus Disease
Ticks of the genera Amblyomma and Ixodes.
In the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in Europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during World War II. Childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to WHO have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. The WHO has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. However, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former Soviet Union. Since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and South America. Without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. Epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. This has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
The first hantavirus found in the New World was Sin Nombre virus in the ‘Four Corners’ area (USA) in 1993, where an outbreak occurred of severe pulmonary disease in previously healthy adults. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have been detected throughout the Americas, with new strains and reservoir hosts. Approximately 200 cases of HPS per year are reported in the Americas. There is no HPS in the Caribbean, probably because the rodent host Sigmodontinae is infrequent there. The number of cases is much smaller than that of HFRS in the Old World, but the CFR is higher. Cases confirmed by serology have been reported in Colombia and Venezuela but the identity of the hantavirus unknown. Seoul virus (see Hantavirus Disease, OldWorld map) seropositives in humans and Rattus norvegicus are found in many port cities in the Americas, spread by shipping, but without evidence of disease. Risk of exposure to hantavirus is correlated with outdoor occupations such as agriculture, in which a person might encounter rodents or their excreta; the greatest risk is entering rodent-infested closed buildings. Epidemiology differs by country and virus. In household contacts of index patients with HPS in Chile, the risk of secondary cases was 17.6% among sex partners and 1.2% among other household members. Infection is more common in males, with most cases occurring within the 20–40 age group.
Supportive.

Commonly 28–30 days, ranging from 15 to 50 days.
TBE causes acute meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis with or without myelitis. Severity of disease increases with age, with an excess of males and is highest in adults, of whom half develop encephalitis. It begins with fever (99%), fatigue, and general malaise (62%), headache and body pain (54%). In diphasic infections (EUR), neurological symptoms appear 4–10 days after apparent recovery. FE disease is often severe with signs of encephalitis, focal epilepsy and flaccid paralysis of the shoulder girdle (CFR: 5–40%); EUR is a milder disease, with death and severe sequelae less frequent than in FE. Long-lasting or permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae are observed in 10–20% or more of infected patients. Infections with the European and Siberian subtypes are less severe (CFR: 1–3%).
Personal anti-insect measures; there is no vaccine. Removal of culicoides breeding sites in cacao husks and felled banana trunks.
Clinical presentation depends on level of immune suppression. P. marneffei is most often an opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts (<100 cells/m L). Most present with fever and typical skin lesions. Other findings are anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. Respiratory signs can also be observed. Skin lesions are often papules with central necrosis on the face and neck, but other body sites can also have lesions. Other opportunistic infections also need to be excluded in these patients.
PCR on blood or skin biopsy, or IFA on the latter. Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
Humans.
Monkey–mosquito–monkey; P. knowlesi has a short (24-hour) asexual lifeycle; humans are incidental hosts.
The majority of infections are subclinical ( 95%). Those with disease have mild fever, maculopapular rash often involving the palms and soles, which may be hemorrhagic and may recur, polyarthritis of both large and small joints, occasionally swollen extremities, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy. The disease is more severe in Scandinavia and South Africa than elsewhere. The disease is non-fatal, but moderate residual pain and stiffness in the joints may persist for years.

Lyme Disease
By tick bite or crushing an infected tick or its feces into a break in the skin or mucous membrane. Also by blood transfusion and, in the laboratory, aerosol.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus. It is divided into five antigenic groups and four genotypes, whichmay belinked to differences in virulence.
Noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe, mutilating orofacial gangrene, which is painless and usually unilateral. It begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face, including the bone, which may result in severe disfigurement and even death. Noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals (noma pudenda).
TB is a chronic disease with a gradual onset. Pulmonary lesions occur in 70% of cases, extrapulmonary (meningitis, skeletal, any other organ, disseminated) in 30%. Extrapulmonary TB is more common in children <5 years. Early symptoms of pulmonary TB are weight loss, fever, and night sweats, progressing to cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Findings of extrapulmonary TB depends on infected organ(s), and may present together with pulmonary TB.
Poliomyelitis
River blindness, onchodermatitis.
Ebola viruses (genus Ebolavirus), marburg viruses (genus Marburgvirus), and ‘cueva viruses’, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales; enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses.

Mosquito bite; transovarial transmission has been demonstrated in Aedes vigilax. There is no direct personto-person transmission.
Fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. When ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. The cycle takes approximately 3 months.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Noma
Doxycycline for 6 weeks, in combination with either rifampicin for 6 weeks, or streptomycin for 2–3 weeks, or gentamicin for 1–2 weeks.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive, aerobic rod that is classified into three potentially toxigenic biotypes, intermedius, mitis, and gravis. Toxin producing strains of C. diphtheriae carry a bacteriophage-derived tox gene. Toxinproducing strains of C. ulcerans may also cause respiratory diphtheria.
Generally enzootic cycles of F. tularensis are unnoticed, humans are accidental hosts.
Rarely by tick bite.
Direct: acid fast smear/culture and PCR of sputum and other body fluids, depending on clinical presentation; serological: tuberculin skin test (Mantoux); interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Culture in liquid media is gold standard and allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing but takes weeks to months; PCR allows for early detection, and recent assays include detection of resistance-associated mutations.
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. Only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months. Differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and HBV genotype. Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
Tabanid adult female flies, mainly Chrysops silacea, C. dimidiata, and C. distinctipennis. These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments (e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation). Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations. Chrysops are attracted by movement, dark objects, and smoke. The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns. Up to 18% of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas.
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), a type C retrovirus with at least 6 subtypes. The virus was isolated for the first time in the USA in 1980, before HIV-1 (also a retrovirus) was discovered in 1983. Genomically, simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolates cluster closely with HTLV-1 in the same region, suggesting simian-to-human transmission at multiple occasions.
Japanese Encephalitis
ICD-9 066.2; ICD-10 A92.2
Since the virus has a jungle cycle, environmental insecticide spraying is not feasible; routine personal anti-mosquito measures are indicated.
Ebola and Marburg Virus Disease
Common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. Adults may have constipation, while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea. In 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. Children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. Complications occur in 10–15%, including GI bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy. CFR is approximately 2% (range: Common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. Adults may have constipation, while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea. In 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. Children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. Complications occur in 10–15%, including GI bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy.
Blood feeding reduviid bugs of the genera Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus. The most common vector in south America is Triatoma infestans. The vector lives up to 2 years.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is an enveloped, spherical virus with a tripartite, singlestranded, negative sense RNA genome, belonging to the genus Nairovirusin the family Bunyaviridae. It has 7 genotypes distinguished by the small (S) segment of the RNA.
Typically from 2 to 14 days, longer in immunocompromised persons.
Rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
PCR on blood or skin biopsy, or IFA on the latter. Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity. Until recently, R. parkeri cases were misdiagnosed as RMSF.
For mild cases, an oral triazole; for severe cases, amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year.
Fluorquinolones are recommended in the absence of resistance. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole is widespread and resistance to older generation quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins is rising. Both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated cases in areas with MDR or nalidixic acid resistance. Third-generation cephalosporins is used for severe cases. Surgery for abdominal complications (e.g. perforation). Dexamethason is recommended for severe cases.
ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. This large epidemic was remarkable because, in spite of the occurrence of millions of cases, no deaths were reported. It ended without a trace in 1962, reappearing as sporadic cases in Africa at rare intervals. In Nigeria in 1966 and 1969, cases were described as a new virus, IgboOra, later recognized as ONNV. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody. It is not known how or where the virus survives between outbreaks, but sequence data show very little variation between ONNV strains isolated in Uganda in 1959 and 1996–1997, suggesting that the virus persists, rather than undergoing repeated mutations from CHIKV (which has a non-human primate reservoir).
Microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the Kato–Katz or rapid sedimentation techniques (RSTs) are diagnostic for the chronic infection. Serological tests (Fas2ELISA) is recommended for acute infection. The intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used. Radiology, such as computed tomography, can demonstrate liver lesions (only in acute infection) similar to metatastic lesions. For chronic infections, a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites.
Viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding, then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days, the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding.
Q fever has been described world wide, with the exception of New Zealand. Though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries, serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions. Most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep. The largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010, mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms. The outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure. People living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away. The hospitalization rate was relatively high, 20% versus around 5% which is normally reported.
Light microscopy of Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears; rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on immunochromatography on blood; PCR.
Detection of spirochetemia in blood smears with dark-field or conventional microscopy; blood culture in special media or mouse inoculation; quantitative buffy coat (QBC) fluorescence; PCR.
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes, dogs, and cats or contaminated fomites. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Pigs and humans are definitive hosts; less often dogs.

ICD-9 202; ICD-10 B97.33 (virus), C84.1 Sezary disease, C84.5 Other and unspecified T-cell lymphomas, C91.4 Hairy cell leukemia, C91.5 ATL.
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. Humans that regularly work with animals (farmers, herders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers) are at increased risk of infection. Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams. RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa, but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands. As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall, outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented.
ICD-9 046.1; ICD-10 A81.0
African Bunyamwera viruses known to cause human disease circulate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Virus transmission peaks in the rainy season when mosquitoes are abundant. All age groups can be infected, though BUNV mainly affects children. BUNV is particularly active in the riverine forests in Nigeria and CAR. 100% of adults living in tropical rainforest of the DRC are seropositive. Neutralizing antibody rates of over 50% for ILEV have been found in people in savannah areas of Nigeria. Lower seroprevalences of ILEV are found in rainforests. GERV is endemic in southern African countries. To date, GERV has not been reported to be responsible for any major human disease outbreaks, and is therefore considered of minor public health importance.
Cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis (CL): Aleppo evil, Baghdad boil, Delhi boil, Oriental sore, Delhi boil, and others.
Many species of mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Mansonia, Culex, and Anopheles.
Clonorchiasis is the most common liver fluke in humans. Estimates show that approximately 35 million people are infected world wide, of which 15 million are in China. In endemic areas, the highest prevalence is in adults over 30 years of age. The intensity of human infection depends on the eating habits of the population. In Asia, eating raw fish is common together with alcohol consumption and, therefore, men are more often infected than women. The incidence is low in children. In China the prevalence in some regions is increasing, probably due to increased consumption of raw freshwater fish. The geographical extent of the disease is determined by snail distribution, the eating habits of the local population, and contamination of freshwater with egg-containing feces. In southern China the disease is maintained by the practice of using human feces in carp raising ponds to promote plankton growth, on which the fish feed. In non-endemic areas it appears in Asian immigrants, and in people who consume raw, dried, smoked or pickled fish imported from endemic areas.
Treponema pallidum ssp. endemicum (bejel), T. pallidum ssp. pertenue (yaws), and T. carateum (pinta), spirochetes that are morphologically and serologically similar to T. pallidum ssp. pallidum, the agent of syphilis.
Large trematode liver flukes living in blile ducts: Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. F. hepatica is 20 to 30 mm long and F. gigantica can be up to 75 mm long.
Leishmania species, protozoa, members of the Trypanosomatidae family, order Kinetoplastida. Leishmania species that cause CL in the old world are: Leishmania major, L. tropica, and L. aethiopica. L. killicki is synonymous to L. tropica. L. infantum/chagasi and L. donovani can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. L. chagasi is considered the same species as L. infantum, and are referred to as L. infantum/chagasi.
Rats and other rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the most important zoonotic reservoirs of human infection.
ICD-9 023; ICD-10 A23.1
Usually 14–84 days for acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome); chronic schistosomiasis can be asymptomatic for a long period, months to years.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
Freshwater snails: Biomphalaria spp. for S. mansoni, Bulinus spp. for S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, and S. guineensis. Technically, humans are the ‘vector’ as they harbor the parasite’s sexual stage. Snails are intermediate hosts.
Humans.
The natural reservoir is unclear. The fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). The disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. Culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. As armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. By using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of P. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
Mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. Humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. Chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.Urinary carriagemay occur in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease. Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. In immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.
O’nyong-nyong Virus Disease
None.
Early phase: RT-PCR on blood; serology (IgM and IgG), but there is cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses; positive serology requires confirmation by more specific tests, like plaque-reduction assay.
For LBRF, humans; for TBRF, wild rodents, bats and ticks (by trans-stadial and transovarian transmission). B. duttonii has thus far not been detected in wild animals, only in humans and tick vector O. moubata. Livestock may also become infected.
Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped RNA virus, genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. There are four antigenically related, but distinct, dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4), all of which can cause DF/DHF.
Infective sporozoites are inoculated by the bite of anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites, or to a dormant stage (hypnozoite) that can become active after months or years, causing relapse. Merozoites released from liver infect erythrocytes that develop to schizonts, rupture and release merozoites that will infect new erythrocytes (this cycle takes 48 hours). Some merozoites develop into gametocytes that are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal.
ICD-9 026; ICD-10 A25
Through contamination of penetrating wounds (e.g. by thorns, splinters). There is no person-to-person transmission.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment. Aspirin should be avoided.
Rubella
Microscopy for eggs, larvae and/or adult worms in the stool, or in intestinal biopsies for C. philippinensis (eggs resemble those of Trichuris trichiura).
Personal anti-mosquito precautions; vector control; screening blood and transplant products. There is no vaccine approved for human use. There are several veterinary vaccines.
P. knowlesi transmission is restricted to the Leucosphyrus group of anophelines, consisting of 20 species.
Culture (cysteine-enriched media) or PCR on specimens of affected tissues. Blood cultures are often negative. Testing should be done in a BSL-3 facility. Serology on acute and convalescent sera.
Intestinal capillariasis starts with mild abdominal pain, borborygmus, and diarrhea, that develops to profuse watery diarrhea. If untreated: chronic diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption, leading to weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia, and eventually death. Hepatic capillariasis (C. hepatica) is a (sub)acute hepatitis with eosinophilia, that may disseminate to other organs and can be fatal. Pulmonary capillariasis (C. aerophila) may present with fever, cough, asthma, and pneumonia and may also be fatal.
Oral commensal bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. nucleatum and a spirochete (formerly identified as Borrelia vincenti) are the suspected etiological agents.
Food-borne trematodiasis is focal and occurs in areas where the snail and freshwater fish – that is consumed raw or undercooked – coexist. The disease is the leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma in the world. O. viverrini is common in Southeast Asia in the Mekong region with 8 million infected in Thailand and 2 million in Laos. In Thailand about 8.7% of the population is infected and mainly in the northern provinces. Control activities in Thailand were able to reduce the prevalence from 34% to 10% in several areas. No data is available for Cambodia, China, or Vietnam, although opisthorchiasis is likely common there. O. felineus is found in Europe and northern Asia with approximately 5 million infected. Infected fish can be shipped and consumed in non-endemic areas.
Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. The range of Junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. Deforestation and human invasion into rodent habitat may have resulted in increased human exposure to infected rodents and a concomitant increase in human illnesses (see Forest Cover map). Only single cases of an infection by Sabia and Chapare viruses have been recorded. Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases.
An estimated 650 million people are at risk in 10 provinces of China. The distribution is closely correlated with the habit of consuming raw terrestrial molluscs, reptiles, or amphibians. The majority of cases are in adults, except in Taiwan where most cases are in children. Pomacea canaliculata, a snail native to South America, was imported into Taiwan in 1981 as a food source and then into mainland China. It has replaced A. fulica as the main intermediate host of A. cantonensis and has become the main source of human infection in Taiwan and mainland China. Depending on the region, up to 70% of P. canaliculata can be infected. Eating raw frogs also lead to human infections in China, and the USA. Consumption of lizards caused several cases in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India. Cases have been seen in at least five countries in Europe and New Zealand in travelers returning from endemic regions. Malnutrition and debilitating diseases can exacerbate the infection.
ICD-9 021; ICD-10 A21
Noma can be prevented through health education, poverty reduction, improved nutrition, promotion of breastfeeding, proper prenatal care and immunisations against childhood diseases.
Diphtheria
The most prevalent HTLV-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with ATL (immunosuppression) or associated with HAM/TSP (immunoactivation). The HTLV-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and ATL. The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP.
Bat to bat via unknown route. Humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts.
Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode (roundworm). Adult female worm is approximately 50 cm long.
Consumption of raw or undercooked vector molluscs, infested vegetables or vegetable juice, or other fresh water related food.
Chinese liver fluke, Oriental liver fluke.
4–5 days.
Bairnsdale ulcer (southern Australia), Daintree ulcer (northern Australia) Kumusi ulcer (Papua New Guinea), Searl ulcer.
Dengue-like acute febrile illness with chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and severe arthralgia of the small joints of the hands and feet, sometimes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, painful lymphadenopathies and often a maculopapular rash. Arthralgias may persist for months, but no fatalities have been recorded.
Larval stage of the pork tapeworm T. solium. Adult T. solium can be 2–5 meters in length and lives in the small intestine of human host.
The disease is distributed worldwide, with the majority cases attributed to contaminated processed foods. Listeriosis is, after salmonellosis, the second most frequent cause of food-borne infection-related deaths in Europe. The disease incidence has decreased in the USA, while it increased in Europe for unknown reasons. The more regular use of immunosuppressive medications and the increasing size of the elderly population has increased the population at risk in both Europe and the USA. The majority of invasive listerial infections occurs in individuals with predisposing conditions: pregnancy, corticosteroid use, or other immunosuppressive conditions. One-third of reported cases occur in pregnant women. In non-pregnant patients corticosteroid use is the most important predisposing factor. Clinical data from Asia, Africa, and South America are lacking. L.monocytogenes has been found in food products from these regions. Food-borne outbreaks, many of which are manifested by febrile gastroenteritis, have been described with a variety of foods. The most common are processed/delicatessen meats, hot dogs, soft cheeses, smoked seafood, meat spreads, and pates. Infections from animal contact are uncommon and generally occur in veterinarians, abattoir workers, and farmers.
Few weeks to months.
By mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission.
In Africa, isolated from Aedes africanus, Ae. apicoargenteus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. vittatus, and Ae. furcifer mosquitoes; probably Ae. hensilii on Yap island.
Avoid eating raw slugs, snails, other molluscs, freshwater prawns, land crabs, and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds (e.g. watercress) from endemic areas.Washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination. Boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 C for 24 hours.
Multiple species of the spirochetal genus, including Leptospira interrogans, which is the species associated withmost severe disease. There are currently 8 species found to be pathogenic for humans, associated with > 250 serovars belonging to the pathogenic species. Antigenically related serovars are grouped into 24 serogroups. A single serovar may belong to different Leptospira species.
Principally wild birds in North America. Wild rodents, bats, reptiles, or amphibians may also be involved. Pheasants may serve as sentinels as they develop fatal disease. Chickens are more typically used as sentinels by detection of seroconversion.
Pulmonary distomiasis, lung fluke disease
Dracunculus medinensis, a nematode roundworm. The longest adult female recorded is 80 cm, and adult male 40 cm.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.). Transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and through blood transfusion.
ICD-9 102.0 (yaws), 103.0 (pinta), 104.0 (endemic syphilis); ICD-10 A65 (endemic syphilis), A66 (yaws), A67 (pinta).
Scrub Typhus
The cestode Diphyllobothrium latum (fish or broad tapeworm), the largest human tapeworm (up to 25 meters long). In Japan and eastern Russia D. nihonkaiense is common. At least 13 other Diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently.
Avoid contamination of skin by potentially infected soil or water. There is no vaccine available.
Self-limiting conjunctivitis, including watery or mucopurulent discharge. Typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis. Trichiasis damages the corneal surface, resulting in keratitis, vascularization of the cornea, and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection. Corneal damage produces corneal scar, leading to blindness.
Via fecal contaminated water, drinks or food from infected individuals or carriers; transmission may also occur in men who have sex with men.
None.
Supportive; intravenous ribavirin and convalescent human serum are recommended.
Trypanosomiasis, African
Leptospirosis
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
Non-invasive GI listeriosis: fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. Invasive listeriosis: septicemia, meningoencephalitis, and perinatal listeriosis. Meningoencephalitis: headache, stiff neck (often absent), confusion, convulsions and coma (CFR: 20–30%). Infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and infection of the newborn. Pregnant womenmost commonly haveflu-likesymptoms. Focalinfections in any organ may occur. Focal cutaneous and eye infections can occur after direct inoculation with contaminated tissue, usually occupational. Listerial gastroenteritis is uncommon.
ICD-9 086.3-086.4; ICD-10 B56.0, B56.1
Gram stain and culture of CSF, blood, or synovial fluid. Capsular polysaccharide antigen detection by latex agglutination or other techniques. PCR from normally sterile site.
The Ixodid ticks are both vector and reservoir. Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor andersoni and D. variabilis (American dog tick) in Canada and the USA, Rhipicephalus sanguineus in Mexico and Central America, and A. cajennense from the southern states of the USA southwards as far as Argentina. D. variabilis is the primary vector for RMSF in the USA. A. maculatum is the main vector of R. parkeri in North America and A. triste in South America.
Endemic treponematoses is now rarely reported since the eradication campaign. Complete eradication may have been achieved if surveillance was continued and rural healthcare services improved. Disease foci still exist, but reports are lacking. Several nations fail to report to avoid the stigma of ‘being backward.’ The WHO has estimated that 2.5 million people are still infected with endemic treponemes, and about 460,000 are actively infectious. The disease primarily afflicts children in tropical and subtropical areas. The distribution of endemic treponematoses is patchy and associated with poverty and poor access to social and healthcare services; it thus affects mainly rural communities in developing countries (see Human Development map). Endemic syphilis generally affects individuals in hot, arid climates, and yaws affects those in hot and humid areas. Pinta is found only in Central and South America, but has not been reported for over 40 years. No endemic syphilis cases have been reported since the 1980s. Yaws is also rare and currentlyis only reported from foci in West Africa and Indonesia. Also, no new yaws cases have been reported in India since 2004. It has been suggested that the presence of non-venereal treponematoses indicates that the country or region has a poor-quality healthcare system.
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children. Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection. Hib may also cause epiglottitis, which presents with fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, talking and breathing. Infections of soft tissue, bones, and joints with H. influenzae may occur.
ICD-10 J12.81
Orientia tsutsugamushi, obligate intracellular bacterium, before 1995 known as Rickettsia tsutsugamushi. In 2010, a new species that can cause scrub typhus was discovered in Dubai, O. chuto.
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.8
Hendra virus and Nipah virus are negative-stranded RNA viruses, and comprise the Henipavirus genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Hendra virus was discovered in horses and stable staff in Australia in 1994, Nipah virus in pigs and pig farmers in the town Nipah, Malaysia, in 1999.
Wild, migratory birds of the order Passeriformes (mainlyfieldfare, redwing, and songthrush) and Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). Tetraonid birds (grouse) population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland. Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species.
Approx. 1 week.
Wild birds. Over 100 bird species can be infected by WNV infection. Many birds get infected and amplify the virus but do not die. The robin is probably the main amplifying host, and rarely has overt disease. American crows, blue jays, and hawks are susceptible to death. The number WNV bird deaths can predict subsequent disease severity in humans and equines.
Supportive; there is no specific therapy.
Supportive, including rehydration. Avoid aspirin because of potential hemorrhage.
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. In case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. Heart valve replacement may be needed.
Clonorchiasis
Human-deer-fly-human. After infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. Adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. In the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. An infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. Transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
Mebendazole or albendazole; radical surgical excision.
Microscopy of stool specimens cannot distinguish between E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii, and E. dispar; PCR is able to distinguish between these species; stool antigen tests can identify E. histolytica. 
Rodents, voles (B. microti), cattle (B. divergens), lagomorphs (B.divergens-like), possibly horses (B. duncani, formerly type WA1), or sheep (Babesia type KO1).
Depends on the type of infection and severity. S. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. It also is a common cause of otitis media and sinusitis. It can cause deep-seated infections involving any organ in a disseminated disease.
ICD-9 085; ICD-10 B55
Poliovirus, an RNA enterovirus with three types; type 1 cases are most common, followed by type 3; wild type 2 disappeared in 1999. Rare cases of all three types occur in unimmunized contacts of children vaccinated with the Sabin live attenuated vaccine.
Whooping cough
Intestinal capillariasis, Pudoc mystery disease, wasting disease.
ICD-9 078.6; ICD-10 A98.5
Adult worm can be extracted by carefully and slowly winding the worm around a stick over a period of days. Metronidazole or thiabendazole can facilitate the extraction process, but should be used with caution.
Knowlesi malaria, simian malaria
Varies from 1 to 3 months.
IgG and IgM antibody detection to phase I and II antigens by IFA, CFT, or ELISA; immunohistology; PCR; ultrasound for endocarditis.
10–12 days, range: 6–21 days.
JEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia: 35,000 to 50,000 cases are reported annually but this believed to be a significant underestimate of the true disease burden. 20–30% die and 30–50% of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae. It is epidemic in temperate parts of Asia, linked to the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes, and endemic in tropical regions of Asia due to the year-round mosquito activity. Intensification and expansion of irrigated rice production systems in South and Southeast Asia over the past 20 years have had an important impact on the disease burden caused by Japanese encephalitis, since the vectors breed in rice fields. The vectors prefer non-human hosts, but do feed on humans in periods of peak activity. The disease is mainly seen in children under the age of 15 and the elderly, since most adults are immune from earlier infection; peak age is 3–5 years. The range of JE virus has recently expanded into the Torres Strait of northern Australia, but the disease is rare in western Pacific islands.
Prevention of exposure to the wild aquatic bird reservoir and domestic poultry (farm biosecurity). Surveillance for infected poultry flocks and culling of infected flocks (stamping out). Poultry workers and cullers must wear protective clothing. Education of poultry farmers and the general public to reduce high-risk exposures. Human cases must be isolated, close contacts monitored, and healthcare workers must wear personal protective equipment.
4 months to several years.
It is estimated that 17 million people are infected world wide and 91 million are at risk of infection. F. hepatica is endemic on all continents but is of particular public health importance in the Andean countries (especially Peru and Bolivia), Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Philippines, and western Europe (e.g. France, Portugal, and Spain). Infections with F. gigantica are restricted to Africa and Asia. Both species of fluke overlap in many areas of Africa and Asia, whereas F. hepatica is the major concern in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. The rural areas of the Andean region of Peru and Bolivia have prevalence rates of up to 68%. Women are affected more than men, with higher prevalence rates, more severe infections, and more reported liver or biliary complications; children are affected more than adults. The main source of infection is the consumption of raw vegetables contaminated with metacercariae, such as watercress, salads, and contaminated water from irrigation channels. Pharyngeal fascioliasis may occur after ingestion of raw goat or sheep liver – a dish in some Middle Eastern countries.
Sudden onset of high fever (biphasic), chills, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, ocular pain, conjunctivitis, anorexia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Spleen and liver can be palpable, and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found. A few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash. Prolonged convalescence may follow. Children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations, including a more pronounced rash, DIC, and GI bleeding; or CNS involvement including meningitis and encephalitis. Fatalities are rare.
A zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, and is closely related to Legionella spp., Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia spp. C. burnetii is classified as a potential biological warfare agent.
In Africa, the principal vectors are the sylvan mosquitoes Ae. furcifer and Ae. africanus, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. taylori; in Asia, urban Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and various Culex species.
Polysaccharide vaccines against A, C, Y, and W135 are available. These vaccines are safe and effective in adults and older children but are poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 2 and the duration of protection is limited to 3–5 years. The development of a group C conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is effective in children under the age of 2 years has been an important advance, and conjugate vaccines are now available for A, C, Y, and W135. The development of a group B vaccine remains a challenge. Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts eradicates carriage and reduces the incidence of secondary cases. Vaccination of household contacts may also prevent further cases.
Onchocerciasis
Mosquitoes, principally canopy-dwelling Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. The virus has also been isolated from Psorophora, Mansonia and Culex spp.
Mumps virus, an enveloped RNA virus of the family Paromyxoviridae. Twelve genotypes are currently recognized.
Plasmodium ovale, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Phylogenetically, P. ovale clusters with other Plasmodium species affecting simian primates.
Invasive disease: tinidazole or metronidazole. For severe amebic colitis antibiotics are added to prevent and treat bacterial peritonitis. Surgery for intra-abdominal complications (e.g. bleeding, perforation). Aspiration for liver abscesses. Intraluminal parasites and asymptomatic infection are treated with paromomycin.
Supportive. Cidofovir has proven anti-monkeypox viral activity in vitro and in animal studies, but its efficacy in patients is unknown, neither is any benefit from treatment with vaccinia immune globulin known.
Piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. Humans can remain infected for several decades.
Cysticerosis has a worldwide distribution, mainly where pigs are consumed and sanitation is substandard (see Streptococcus suis map for pig density and Sanitation map). In endemic countries it is an important cause of epilepsy, causing a high disease burden in mainly poor families. In several countries neurocysticercosis is the cause of 10–50% of seizures. Neurocysticercosis is common in Latin America and non-Muslim African and Asian countries where pig is eaten and traditional pig rearing is practiced. Regions with the habit of eating raw or undercooked pig meat are at increased risk. In Europe, cysticercosis has largely disappeared due to strong health system and good sanitation. In several developed nations, like the USA and Spain, there is an increase in certain regions where lots of migrants live who have come from high endemic countries. Tapeworm carriers can cause small outbreaks, as was observed in a Jewish community in New York that employed cooks from Latin America.
1–14 days; most commonly 3–5 days.
Hygiene; access to clean water; sanitation (see Water and Sanitation map). A vaccine has been developed and proven effective, but is not yet available.
Cattle, swine, goats, sheep, and various wildlife species. B. canis in dogs and coyottes.
Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, intracellular Gram-negative bacilli.
LPAI viruses naturally circulate in wild birds, principally waterfowl and gulls, in which they generally cause no symptoms. LPAI viruses are transmitted to terrestrial poultry (chickens, turkeys). LPAI most likely evolved to HPAI in aquatic birds (ducks and geese). Transmission of HPAI into migratory birds can result in large die-offs.
Microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon; membrane filtration; PCR. Eosinophilia and high IgE levels are indicators of active infection.
