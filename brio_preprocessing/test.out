The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions.
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers.
Histology is the gold standard. M. leprae cannot be cultured in vitro.
(1) hypopigmented or reddish skin lesion(s) with loss of sensation, (2) thickening of the peripheral nerves with loss of sensation, and (3) acid-fast bacilli in skin smear (often negative).
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. BCG vaccination provides variable protection: from 34% to 80%.
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. leprae bacilli remain viable for 9 days in dried nasal secretions and about 6 weeks in moist soil.
The disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. India had the most new cases in 2008 (134,000), followed by Brazil (39,000), and Indonesia (17,000). Foci in Brazil are found in the Amazonian jungle, but also in arid areas. Poverty and crowded dwellings are important risk factors.
The disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. WHO reported 213,036 leprosy cases at the beginning of 2009.

Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water.

JEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia.  It is epidemic in temperate parts of Asia, linked to the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes, and endemic in tropical regions of Asia due to the year-round mosquito activity. The range of JE virus has recently expanded into the Torres Strait of northern Australia, but the disease is rare in western Pacific islands.

MPV is endemic in heavily forested areas of Africa, primarily of low altitude and high humidity. Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006–2007 (14.5 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs (native ground squirrels) either at a child-care center or from pet stores.

The illness begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and headache followed by unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral tender swelling of the parotid (parotitis) or other salivary glands. Parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. Infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis. Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody.

The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, cases have decreased significantly. There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. In 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC.

The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (G1–G4 and G9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with G1[P8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but only 30% of infections in South America, Asia, and Africa.

SINV has been isolated from Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. The highest disease burden is in northern Europe (approximately between 60 and 64 N) and South Africa. Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America, with subsequent spread to North America, Asia, and Australia, with later spread to Europe and Africa. Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland, with the last epidemic in 2002.

In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period.

WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America.
