ICD-9 002.0; ICD-10 A01
Buruli ulcer is named after Buruli county in Uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. The disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. West Africa is the most affected region. Typical Buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. Flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. Outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in Africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. In southern Australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. It is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. World wide, mainly children are susceptible to Buruli ulcer disease.
Dengue-like acute febrile illness with sudden onset fever, severe chills, severe headache, eye pain, symmetrical polyarthralgia of all joints (as opposed to dengue, which attacks mainly elbows and knees), generalized myalgia, sometimes dry cough and coryza, leucopenia and often an itching, descending morbilliform rash. Marked cervical lymphadenitis distinguishes it from chikungunya infection. Hemorrhagic signs have not been seen. Recovery is complete, without sequelae.
Penicilliosis
16–18 days (range 12–24 days)
None.

ICD-9 082.0; ICD-10 A77.0
Avoid consumption of inadequately cooked marine fish. Clean the fish early after they are caught as larvae migrate from viscera into fish flesh after death. Freezing at 20 C for at least 7 days kills larvae. Larvae can survive 50 days in vinegar. For allergic patients: avoid food that may contain allergen.
Humans. Cattle and other livestock may harbor C. ulcerans
Detection of eggs in feces (eggs resemble those of Fasciola hepatica). Adult flukes may be seen in the stools or vomit.
Approximately 50 days, but varies.
In addition to humans, dogs and fish-eating terrestrial and marine mammals can also serve as definitive hosts for D. latum.
Histoplasmosis
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission.
Tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations. Humans and lizards are dead-end hosts.
Larva currens.
3–12 days.
Barmah Forest virus (BFV) and Ross River virus (RRV), enveloped RNA viruses, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. An early isolate of BF from Queensland was initially named Murweh virus. There are two topotypes of Ross River virus, from eastern and western Australia; a third, in northeastern Australia, has not been found since the mid-1970s.
Rotavirus diarrhea, acute viral gastroenteritis, severe viral gastroenteritis.
Plasmodium vivax, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa.
WHO (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in India and Sub Saharan Africa. 90% of the infections are due to W. bancrofti. Chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. About 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). Asia and South America have lower Bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than Sub Saharan Africa (up to 37%) and Pacific Island (up to 48%) regions. Within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. Reciffe, Brazil). In the Americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. China has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and Korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. The vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
Penicillin and metronidazole; rehydration; nutritional rehabilitation; treatment of predisposing diseases (e.g. malaria, measles, tuberculosis); wound disinfection; reconstructive surgery.
Humans.
Antibiotic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic is mainly indicated to reduce communicability in those presenting within 3 weeks of onset. Hospitalization may be needed in severe causes for supportive care.
Small wild mammals such as rodents, snowshoe hares, deer and vector mosquitoes (venereal and transovarian transmission occur). Dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of LACV, as the main vector (Aedes triseriatus) only bites in daytime. For this reason, nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with LACV. The white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for JCV (horses can also be an amplifying host). Snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of SSHV.
ICD-9 088.0; ICD-10 A44
Large marsupials, particularly kangaroos and wallabies.
Measles
Endoscopic removal of larvae; albendazole; surgery for complications. Allergic patients: symptomatic treatment.
Respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria, or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers. Direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases. People recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks. Rarely from contaminated items. In the past, outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk.
Days to weeks.
By inhalation of aerosols from dried rodent excreta (this is unlike other Bunyaviruses that are generally arthropod-borne). Person-to-person transmission has been reported for ANDV.

Hepatitis C
Trachoma
ICD-9 480.8; ICD-10 B33.4
Painless cutaneous lesions appear at the site of sandfly bite and typically these develop into ulcers with a raised border. Occasionally nodular and rarely verrucous lesions. Multiple lesions and regional lymphadenopathy may be present. Lesions may resolve spontaneously or remain for several months to years. Rarely dissemination to mucosa occurs of the upper respiratory tract with local tissue destruction leading to disfigurement (most often by L. braziliensis, known as espundia), with risk of severe and sometimes fatal secondary infections.
ICD-9 001; ICD-10 A00
Microscopy (Kato-Katz method). Quantitative fecal egg counts are a marker for worm burden: 2,000 to 4,000 eggs per gram of feces is considered to be moderate infection, and 4,000 eggs is heavy infection.
ICD-9 070.3; ICD-10 B16 and B18.
Oro-fecal. 100% of susceptible contacts become infected. Virus appears in the throat < 36 hours after infection, for a week, and in the feces after 72 hours for 3–6 weeks. Transmission through contaminated water and food has been reported rarely.
Intestinal tract of animals and humans, and soil.
Humans and possibly cats.
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil. There is no person-to-person transmission.
SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae. The viral membrane contains a transmembrane (M) glycoprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, and envelope (E) protein. Coronaviruses derive their name from the crown-like (coronalike) morphology on electron microscopy.
Brucellosis is a common zoonosis with approximately 500,000 new cases per year world wide. The disease occurs mostly in areas where it is common to consume unpasteurized dairy products (soft cheese) and where poor veterinary health systems exist. The main Brucella infecting species vary by region. Incidence is highest in males with occupational exposure. The highest incidences are recorded in Mediterranean countries, Middle East, Central America, and Central Asia. Five of 10 countries with highest incidences are in the Middle East, with Syria leading. Many of the high-incidence countries were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Since their independence the veterinary health system has deteriorated, leading to an increase in brucellosis cases. In the USA it is mainly reported in Hispanics eating imported infected food. The disease is not considered highly endemic in South America. Data from Brazil is lacking, despite high cattle densities in this country (see Livestock map). Many western European countries have brucellosis-free status. Mediterannean European countries implemented eradication campaigns, but still a high prevalence exists, especially in the Balkan peninsula. In eastern Europe the disease is limited to veterinarians.
Mainly humans; yaws is also found in non-human primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas).
Hendra virus: encephalitis and pneumonia, with a rapid progression to death (few survive). One case recovered from encephalitis but relapsed 14 months later and died with neurologic signs, suggesting latency and recrudescence. Nipah virus: encephalitis and pneumonia. There has been a case of relapse encephalitis more than 4 years after infection. The CFR can vary from 10 to 75%, but is generally high.
None.

Several serologic tests are available. Virus can be isolated or RNA detected in acute blood by RT-PCR.
ICD-9 A41.09; ICD-10 A40.8
Acute irregular fever, chills, sweating, arthralgia, headache, and depression. Evidence of localized suppurative infections may be found in liver, spleen, genitourinary tract, and osteo-articular (joints and sacrum). Symptoms may last for months and vary from mild to severe and even fatal (CFR: <2%).
Wear impermeable gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs; cook wild game well; avoid drinking water from untreated sources; wear long-sleeved clothes and use repellent to protect against arthropod bites.
ICD-9 084; ICD-10 B50
For meningitis or septicemia, prompt treatmentwith appropriate antibiotics (penicillin, ceftriaxon) will lead to recovery. Specific organ involvement like the heart, requires specialist treatment. Early treatment with dexamethason can reduce the risk of hearing loss.
ICD-9 087; ICD-10 A68.0 – A68.1
Especially prevalent in pig-rearing regions of Southeast Asia, where it is estimated that 10 million people are infected. The disease is most common in lowlands where the snail host is present and it is common practice to fertilize water plants with pig or human feces. Disease spread is facilitated by heavy rainfall and extensive flooding, leading to fecal contamination of the water. Highest incidence and intensity of infection is found in 10 to14 year old children (no sex difference), probably because they pick and consume water plants when they play. In foci of parasite transmission, the prevalence of infection in children ranges from 57% in mainland China to 25% in Taiwan, and from 50% in Bangladesh and 60% in India to 10% in Thailand. Water morning glory (Ipomoea aquatica), water caltrop (Trapa bicornis), lotus (Nymphaea lotus), water cress (Neptunia oleracea), and water hyacinth (Eichhornia speciosa) are most responsible for human infection, but cysts also float on the surface and may be drunk.
World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. CRS is also grossly underreported. For example, it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009. Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries. Paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases.
Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation. There is no specific treatment, but ribavirin may have some effect. Monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis before onset of clinical signs.
IgM ELISA, RT-PCR, virus isolation from blood, urine, or throat washing, seroconversion to IgG positive.
Varies by agent but is generally 7 days with a range from 1 to 15 days.
Crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host, excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues, usually the lungs. There they encapsulate, mature, and lay eggs. Eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed, then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2–4 weeks into miracidia larvae. These penetrate the body of the vector snail, where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish.
Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium. Spirillosis: Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium.
ICD-9 083.1; ICD-10 A79.0
Vaccination of livestock and humans with occupational risk in endemic areas. Antibiotic prophylaxis when exposed and vaccination in case of inhalation anthrax. Infected animal carcases should be burned or deeply buried, preferably at the site of death.
Symptomatic, there is no specific treatment.
ICD-9 039; ICD-10 B47
Tetanus
By tick bite; rarely by blood transfusion and transplacental/perinatal. Ticks must feed for more than 24 hours for transmission to occur.
Doxycycline for acute Q fever. Chronic Q fever endocarditis: a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for approximately 18 months.
Half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease. The most common presentations of acute Q fever are pneumonia, hepatitis, and isolated fever. Other symptoms are neurological (headache, confusion, peripheral neuropathy), sore throat, chills, sweats, rash, and non-productive cough. Proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status. CFR: 1–2%. Chronic Q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease (valve abnormality).
VL is found in 62 countries where an estimated 500,000 cases occur annually and 120 million persons are at risk. Approximately 90% of VL cases occur in rural and suburban areas of five countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil. During epidemics, > 5% of a population may develop symptomatic infection. Persons who are under age of 5 years, malnourished and immunocompromised (including HIV-infected individuals) are more likely to develop symptomatic, often severe, infection. There are indications that VL is spreading to historically nonendemic areas, like northern parts of Europe and Western Upper Nile Sudan. Clearly the distribution of VL is dynamic and adapts to changes in demographics, human behavior, environment (deforestation, urbanization), and host factors (HIV). VL is reported in Chad, DRC, and Zambia, but the infectious agent is unknown.L. donovanishas been foundin Sri Lanka,but only as a cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis.x
Usually 5–15 days.
Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacillus. Y. pestis is considered a potential biological warfare agent.

Larval mites. Nymphs and adults do not feed on vetebrate hosts. The vector has adapted to various ecologies, including mountainous and tropical regions.
Japanese B encephalitis.
Small (6–18 mm long) trematode liver fluke of dogs, cats, and some other fish-eating mammals:Opisthorchis felineus in Europe and northern Asia, O. viverrini in Southeast Asia. Both species live in bile ducts.
As mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread, control is not feasible; personal anti-mosquito measures; eliminating potential breeding sites (e.g. old tires) and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete.
Foxes (including urban foxes) are the definitive hosts, wild rodents (mainly Arvicolidae), voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts. Foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas, partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination.
From 2–3 months to several years. Most infections do not progress to disease.
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.4
Lyme borreliosis, erythema (chronicum) migrans (EM), tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.

Bancroftian filariasis, Brugian filariasis, lymphatic filariasis, Malayan filariasis, Timorean filariasis.
Self-limiting disease.
During outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. Adequate cooking essential; WHO recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 C, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
5–15 years in humans (5–7 weeks in dogs).
Anisakidosis
Dengue
Majority will be asymptomatic in the acute phase, but approximately 80% develops chronic HCV disease. Acute disease: insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, nausea, malaise and vomiting; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine. Most infected cases (approx. 80%) develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom; 20–30% even-tually develop severe liver disease: cirrhosis and liver cancer (may take 20 years and is dependent on the presence of other risk factors). HCV infection is an important cause for liver transplantation in developed countries. There is accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of hepato-cellular carcinoma in: men, elderly, obese, alcoholics, those infected with HIV or hepatitis B virus.
Through contact with infectious respiratory droplets or saliva.
During bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Prevention is focused on eliminating BSE in cattle, preventing infected bovinematerial entering the animal and human food chain, and reducing the risk of secondary transmission to humans in the healthcare setting. To this end many countries have banned bovine meat and bone meal from livestock feed, slaughtered infected herds, and taken other precautions to prevent infected cattle from entering the human food chain. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission of vCJD through blood products include low-risk sourcing and leucodepletion. Further precautionary methods to reduce the risk of transmission through contaminated surgical instruments.
Virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or RT-PCR; serology (IgM ELISA, IFA). Virus isolation should be done in a BSL-4 laboratory.
Standard anti-mosquito precautions.
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, with four lineages: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus
The disease is seasonal, generally coinciding with tick activity; there are peaks of incidence every 5–7 years in China. Europe and Russia have an estimated 12,000 cases per year (2007). In eastern regions the disease coincides with tick habitat in cold, moist forest, but tick ranges extend well beyond reported disease at both eastern and western geographical extremes. During the past two decades, new endemic foci and an increase in cases have been reported in many European countries, in spite of widespread vaccination of at-risk populations. In 1989, FE virus was isolated from Ixodes ovatus ticks and the blood of a febrile patient in Yunnan province, southwestern China. The virus may have completely different rodent hosts and tick vectors from those in northern China.
None.
F. tularensis tularensis Type A is found in North America and the distribution is associatedwith wild rabbits, ticks, and tabanid flies. Type B is found throughout the northern hemisphere, mainly in Eurasia and is associated with multiple rodent species, hares, ticks, blood-feeding mosquitoes, and tabanid flies. There is also an association with water bodies (streams) and flooding. In the USA, around 200 human tularemia cases are reported each year, mostly in rural areas during summer months. In Europe, most cases are reported from Sweden, Finland, and Russia, and is recently emerging in Spain. Rural populations are most at risk (e.g. farmers, hunters). Human outbreaks often coincide with wild animal outbreaks.
Humans.
Humans and non-human primates are the main reservoirs.
Humans.
Contamination of wounds with soil, dust or animal feces that contain C. tetani spores. Puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions. Through injection of contaminated street drugs. Neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord, either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials.
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt. While migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1 (see Bird Migration map), the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic. HPAI H5N1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species, making it an economically important disease. However, it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities. Over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries. The concern remains that H5N1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza A virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person.
Supportive; ribavirin is effective if given within the first 6 days; dialysis if indicated.
High fever with headache, chills, neck stiffness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting developing into aseptic meningitis or encephalitis with disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, drowsiness, and stupor. Death occurs from respiratory complications or seizures. The case fatality rate is around 20%, but can be as high as 60%; 30% of those who survive suffer lasting damage to the central nervous system.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped singlestranded RNA virus, genus Hepevirus, the single member in the Hepeviridae family. The virus can be classified into four genotypes (genotype HEV-1 to HEV-4), and > 24 subgenotypes (1a–1e, 2a–2b, 3a–3j, and 4a–4g). Avian isolates of HEV are now considered to be a separate genus. HEV was discovered in the 1980s as a result of a large water-borne non-A non-B hepatitis outbreak in India between 1978 and 1979.
Soil, (decaying) vegetation, and ruminants. Humans and ruminants can carry listeria in their intestines.
None.
Vivax malaria is the second most important malaria species after P. falciparum and accounts for 25–40% of the cases world wide with 132–391 million cases per year. Outside Africa it is the dominant species, mainly in Asia. The distribution is wider than P. falciparum as it is able to develop at lower temperatures and can form hypnozoites in human liver. The high prevalence of Duffy negativity in western Africa has influenced the epidemiology of P. vivax, as Duffy-negative people are apparently resistant to vivax malaria, although several reports suggest that Duffy-negative people can be infected with P.vivax. The disease burden is greatest in infants. In 2010, an autochtonous P.vivax case was diagnosed in north eastern Spain. Malaria was declared eradicated from Spain in 1964. P.vivax may have been transmitted by the local vector Anopheles atroparvus, which can transmit Asiatic P. vivax strains.
The disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. WHO reported 213,036 leprosy cases at the beginning of 2009. Although the worldwide prevalence has declined in the last two decades, the incidence has remained the same. India had the most new cases in 2008 (134,000), followed by Brazil (39,000), and Indonesia (17,000). Males are affected more than females (2:1); young children are rarely infected. Epicurves for PL show a peak at age 15 followed by a trough at age 20. WHO considers that leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem in any country when the prevalence is less than 1 case per 10,000 population. In 2007, the DRC and Mozambique achieved that status. Also India reported that their national prevalence is below 1/10,000. However, pockets of high endemicity still remain in some areas within those countries. Decreased prevalence without a reduction in incidence maylead to an increase of cases as countries may be less committed to control them once they meet elimination status. Foci in Brazil are found in the Amazonian jungle, but also in arid areas. Poverty and crowded dwellings are important risk factors. Leprosy in North America and Europe has declined to zero cases in line with improvement in living conditions.
Reservoir host to mosquito to reservoir host; 2–5 days viremia in host, 5–7 days in mosquito, then back into host.
Rubeola, morbilli.
Dracunculiasis
By tsetse fly bite (day biters); blood transfusion, and congenital.
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known. In 1998, WHO estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection, and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year, of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west Nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year. It occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children, especially in underdeveloped countries. Peak incidence is at age 1–4 years, the period of growth retardation in deprived children. The etiology is multifactorial: malnutrition, concurrent infections with malaria or measles, bad oral hygiene, severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors. In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients, neonates, HIV-positive and diabetic patients.
ICD-9 123.4; ICD-10 B70.0

Rickettsioses, Tick-borne, New World
Ziehl–Neelsen stain on smears or biopsies, culture (takes 6–12 weeks), PCR, histopathology.
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria. Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. P. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
Uncertain; the mean incubation period is likely to be 10 to 20 years, but shorter periods have been observed in transfusion-associated cases.
Spores of Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive, encapsulated, non-motile rod. The spores are resistant to desiccation, extremes of temperature and pH, ultraviolet radiation and many disinfectants, and can remain viable for 60 years. It is considered a biological warfare agent.
Supportive with pain management.
Human buccal flora.
7–10 days for HME, 7–14 days for HGA, 14 days for Sennetsu fever.
Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The spores can remain viable in the environment for years. C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
Must be done in BSL-4 facilities if samples contain infectious virus. IgM ELISA, RT-PCR and virus isolation can be used on acute specimens; in convalescence, antibody tests; on autopsy specimens, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
Environment with occasional spillover to humans.
Rodents, principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels: marmots, susliks, and prairie dogs. Rabbits, camels, carnivores, and domestic cats may also be infected. Cats can also develop pneumonic plague. The desert regions of Central Asia contain endemic plague foci where the great gerbil is the main host.
Sanitation (particularly use of latrine and maintaining pigs enclosed); hygiene; meat inspection; thorough cooking of pig meat before consumption; treatment of tapeworm carriers. A vaccine has been developed for cattle.
The global number of hookworm disease cases is estimated to be 740 million individuals, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia. The majority (85%) of the hookworm infections are caused by Necator americanus, which is the predominant hookworm of Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. There is strong association between hookworm prevalence and poverty (see Human Development map). The remaining 15% infections by Ancylostoma duodenale are in focal pockets in India, especially around Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and in China north of the Yangtze river. Mixed infections may also occur. Hookworm disease prevalence rises with age and plateaus in adults. Disease is more prevalent where individuals walk barefoot in regions lacking sanitation (see Sanitation map). Hookworm larvae prefer sandy soil in mild humid climates, resulting that individuals living in coastal areas have the highest infection intensity.
5–14 days after infected bite, 30–40 days after infected blood transfusion.

There are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban. All three cycles exist in Africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in South America. The sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes, and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work. The intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of Africa, resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements. Urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population (mainly Aedes aegypti), that subsequently can transmit to other humans.
It is estimated that over one million cases of scrub typhus occur each year. Infections most often occur in rural areas where diagnostic facilities are limited. Scrub typhus is thought to occur within the so-called ‘Scrub typhus triangle,’ bounded by Siberia (north), Kamchatka Peninsula (east), Pakistan (west), and Australia (south). O. tsutsugamushi infection primarily occurs in tropical climate in Asia, but is also found in temperate zones and semi-arid climates, including in scrub, gardens, forests, beach areas, and mountain deserts. In 2010 the western limit of the Orientia genus extended westwards to Dubai when a patient was diagnosed with a new Orientia species (O. chuto). In southern China, human infections typically occur in the summer and in northern areas the disease occurs mainly during autumn and winter. The migration of infested or infected rodents can lead to the establishment of new foci of disease.
Ticks introduce Babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. The sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. Ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. The gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
The California group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain. Each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host, for instance snowshoe hare for SSHV. LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA. Most LACV infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of Ae. triseriatusfrom July to September. Boys are more often affected with LACV, as they more often play in the woods. JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada. The JCV vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from April to June. SSHV, has a different ecosystem: (sub) arctic forests and tundras in Canada and Siberia. SSHV has been detected in China. SSHV transmission occurs during the arctic summer from May to August, and mainly affects children (<10 years), especially boys. Lumbo virus is a strain of TAHV isolated from mosquitoes in Mozambique (Africa), but no human cases have been diagnosed there.
Viral RNA dection in blood by RT-PCR; serology (IgM ELISA; four-fold increasein IgG); virus isolation is insensitive.
Identification of intracellular amastigotes in stained smears from blood, bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes. PCR is sensitive and specific. Serologic tests can be useful, though they may be negative in HIV-infected patients with leishmaniasis. Rapid diagnostic tests (rK39) are available.

ICD-9 085; ICD-10 B55
Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. WEEV is believed to have descended from an ancestral recombinant derived from eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus.
Listeriosis
Possibly mechanic transmission by non-biting flies (Hippelates pallipes) in the transmission of yaws.
Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 patients with HFRS are hospitalized each year throughout the world, more than half of them in China. The main agent of HFRS in Asia is HTNV. SEOV is also an important cause, but has a wider distribution. The most prevalent hantaviral disease in western and central Europe is caused by PUUV, with > 9,000 cases per year. DOBV is restricted to the Balkans. Hantaviral disease is seasonal, linked to the activity of the rodent host. HFRS epidemics are associated with rodent abundance, caused by various seasonal factors. During the agricultural season, infection is linked to outdoor activities, and during the winter, rodents seek shelter in and around buildings and infection is contracted indoors. There have been reports of clinical hantaviral infections in the UK and there is serological evidence of human infection in Israel, Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam and in several African nations.
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons, very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears, or with fomites contaminated with those secretions. Droplets remain infectious for several hours, longer under conditions of low humidity. Measles virus is highly contagious.
An estimated 200,000 yellow fever cases occur annually with 30,000 deaths. The disease is present in the jungles of South America and in the jungles and Savannahs of Sub-Saharan Africa. On both continents it is endemic in various species of forest monkey, transmitted among them by mosquito bite. The disease is more common in West Africa as compared to East Africa. In Africa, mainly children acquire infection as older persons have acquired immunity. In South America, yellow fever is mainly an occupational disease of men who work in forests and can carry the infection back home, causing urban epidemics. The yellow fever virus is thought to have originated in Africa and to have been carried to the Americas in slave ships. Due to the relatively recent introduction (about 500 years ago) in the Americas, the virus has not yet adapted to the reservoir, explaining why South American monkeys become diseased, but not African monkeys. All countries with urban dengue are at risk of the introduction of yellow fever, including Asia and Australasia, because the vector is the same (see Aedes egypti and Aedes albopictus map). Why Asia has remained free from yellow fever is not understood.
Fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. Cycle: Human to human and occasionally animal to human. HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A (see Hepatitis A map).
Gradual onset, malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, chest, and abdominal pain; inflammation and exudation of the pharynx and conjunctivae are common. Progression to multisystem disease occurs in 20% of infections, with hypotension or shock, hemorrhage, pleural effusion, seizures, encephalopathy and edema of the face and neck. Transient alopecia, ataxia, and eighth cranial nerve deafness may follow; deafness may be permanent. In third-trimester pregnant patients, 80% have a fatal outcome and 95% of the fetuses abort. The overall CFR is 1%, but 15–20% in more severe, hospitalized patients.
Usually 2–6 months (range: 10 days to years).
Rabies virus, a rhabdovirus of the genus Lyssavirus, with a nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA genome. At least 11 different genotypes exist, with genotype 1, rabies virus (RABV) causing classic rabies world wide. Genotypes 2–11 have a more limited host-range and geographic distribution: Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), European bat lyssa virus 1 and 2 (EBLV-1/2), Australian bat lyssa virus (ABLV), Aravan virus (ARAV), Irkut virus (IRKV), Khujand virus (KHUV), and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV).
According to the WHO leprosy case definition, at least one of the following: (1) hypopigmented or reddish skin lesion(s) with loss of sensation, (2) thickening of the peripheral nerves with loss of sensation, and (3) acid-fast bacilli in skin smear (often negative). Histology is the gold standard. M. leprae cannot be cultured in vitro.
For bacteria, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, long-acting sulfonamides; for fungi, itraconazole, ketaconazole, or voriconazole. Resection of small lesions; advanced lesions may require amputation of the hand or leg.
Microfilariae ingested by the fly develop in about 7 days into infective L3 stages and migrate to the head and escape into the skin during feeding. In the subcutaneous tissues the L3 larvae moult into L4 stages and produce nodules within which they develop in 10 months into adult filariae and can live there for 14–15 years. The female worms can produce microfilariae for 10 years. Microfilariae are typically found in the skin, skin lymphatics, and ocular tissues. They have a lifespan of up to 2 years. Humans remain infectious for about 10 years, the time the female worm remains fertile, bur reinfection occurs in endemic areas.
Mosquito–reservoir host–mosquito. The mosquito becomes infected during feeding on a viremic reservoir host; once the virus reaches the salivary glands it can be transmitted during feeding to the next reservoir host.
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 5 days after infection. The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, depending on the ambient temperature (extrinsic incubation period), after which it can infect another human during feeding.
Rodent control in and around dwellings; infection control in hospitals, with barrier nursing and precautions to avoid contact with body fluids.
Symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder: fever, headache, myalgia, backache, lymphadenopathy (not seen in smallpox), malaise, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body; the lesions eventually crust and fall off. The outcome can be fatal (CFR: 1–10%).
Trematode worms Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, S. intercalatum, and S. guineensis (formerly known as S. intercalatum). S. haematobium species group contains 8 species, of which not all cause human disease.
Relapsing Fever
Humans
Zika virus, an enveloped RNA flavivirus; closely related to Spondweni virus.
Klebsiella granulomatis, formerly Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, a Gram-negative facultative aerobic coccobacillus.
Paragonimiasis
Plasmodium falciparum, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Among the malaria parasites, P. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality.
Tularemia
There are two phases, divided into an acute phase (Oroya fever) followed after at least 2 weeks by a chronic phase (verruga peruana). Verruga peruana may occur without an evident acute phase. Oroya fever: fever,myalgia, arthralgia, headache, evolving to severe hemolytic anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly; milder symptoms in children. The CFR for untreated Oroya fever is 40–88% and for treated disease is 1–9%. Survivors are immune. Mortality is associated with secondary infections (e.g. Salmonella andToxoplasma). Verruga peruana: There are two phases, divided into an acute phase (Oroya fever) followed after at least 2 weeks by a chronic phase (verruga peruana). Verruga peruana may occur without an evident acute phase. Oroya fever: fever,myalgia, arthralgia, headache, evolving to severe hemolytic anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly; milder symptoms in children. The CFR for untreated Oroya fever is 40–88% and for treated disease is 1–9%. Survivors are immune.
The first human P. knowlesi case acquired in nature was detected in 1965 in Malaysia. P. knowlesi malaria is widely distributed across Sarawak and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo and extends to the state of Pahang in Peninsular Malaysia. P. knowlesi malaria cases have also been acquired in Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, and the Philippines. The distribution and incidence of P. knowlesi malaria is yet unknown. Bases on current knowledge on the vector and reservoir, human knowlesi malaria is likely not rare in areas inhabited by the natural macaque hosts and the vectors. Humans working in the vicinity of forests are considered at risk. Deforestation now also brings humans in semi-urban areas into contact with reservoir hosts. Interestingly, P. knowlesi has been used in the past as a pyretic agent for the treatment of patients with neurosyphilis.
Oropouche virus (OROV), a spherical enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus, belonging to the Orthobunyavirus group of the Bunyaviridae family, with 3 genotypes.
Fascioliasis
Diphyllobothriasis
Around 50–70% of infected individuals develop a self-limiting ‘primary’ HIV illness 1–12 weeks after infection. Time from infection to development of clinically apparent immunodeficiency ranges from less than 1 year to over 15 years.
RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis are characterized by fever, myalgia, malaise, headache, and a maculopapular eruption that can involve the palms or soles. R. parkeri rickettsiosis is milder than RMSF, and often does not require hospitalization. RMSF cases may progress and develop stupor, delirium, ataxia, or coma; RMSF CFR is about 7%. Untreated RMSF is often progressive with a CFR of 20%, which is not the case for untreated R. parkeri rickettsiosis. Most ( > 90%) R. parkeri cases have an eschar, which is rare in RMSF. GI symptoms are common in RMSF and rare in R. parkeri disease.
Vaccination of children with three doses of Hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months, with a booster dose aged 12–15 months. Since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive Hib disease are at increased risk of disease, rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years.
The nematodes: Anisakis simplex, A. physeteris, Pseudoterranova decipiens, and Contracaecum spp. A. simplex and P. decipiens are the most important species for human disease. Anisakis larvae are whitish, tightly coiled, 1.5–2 cm in length, and difficult to see in fish flesh. Pseudoterranova larvae are 2–3 cm in length and red to brown in color.
About 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
About 12 months (10 to 18 months).
Rift Valley Fever
Often misidentified as P. malariae, but skilled microscopists are able to make the distinction. A relatively severe illness with a microscopic diagnosis of P. malariae should alert clinicians to the possibility of P. knowlesi because P. malariae malaria is almost invariably mild. Species can be confirmed by PCR if needed.
Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found, and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago. HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age, with a peak incidence around age 50. Among HTLV-1 carriers, the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3% and 4%. For ATL, this risk is estimated to be 1% to 5% and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general, including ATL, HAM/TSP, uveitis, polymyositis and arthropathy, the lifetime risk may be close to 10%. Japan, Africa, Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence, but the reasons for this are unknown. Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a. Distribution of the infection is focal, e.g. Brazil, Japan, and Iran, where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country. On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37%. Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis, since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan. For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America, HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas, their offspring and sexual contacts, among sex workers and IVDUs.
Pig-to-pig, with occasional spill-over to humans.
By mosquito bite.
Echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere, and is most commonly found in adults. The distribution of infected foxes is highly uneven; sandy soils, dry habitats and large forests are unfavorable for the parasite. In Europe, foxes have adapted well to urban life and urban fox densities now can exceed rural fox densities. However, there is no clear correlation between fox densities and cases of human alveolar echinococcosis. In some areas there is a shift from a sylvatic to a synantropic cycle, including domestic dogs, as was seen in China and Alaska. Such a shift leads to a higher risk of infection in humans. The prevalence in dogs and cats is still very low in Europe, even in areas highly endemic for infection in foxes.
Melioidosis
By mosquito bite.
High altitude rodents, including ground squirrels and porcupines; ticks by trans-stadial transmission; possibly transovarial, but this is considered unlikely.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Usually 1–3 months (rarely <1 week and > 1 year) depending on virus variant, dose, wound severity and distance of wound from the brain.
IgM antibody detection in CSF (in serum may not be from the current infection), neutralization test on paired acute and convalescent sera; RT-PCR. Virus isolation takes time. IFA in necropsy brain tissue is definitive.
Humans.
Lassa Fever
Ribavirin in combination with peg-interferon. Response to interferon differs by HCV genotype: there is a more sustained virological response in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, as compared to HCV genotype1 and 4. The peg-interferon and ribavarin response can be improved by the combination with oral DNA-polymerase and protease inhibitors.
Tick–vertebrate–tick, with humans as incidental hosts.
A papule at the bite site develops into a painful chancre (mainly T.b. rhodesiense), with fever, severe headache, lympadenopathy, insomnia and progresses to variable neurological symptoms including a disrupted sleep cycle, confusion, seizures, and, if left untreated, eventually death.
Humans; forest monkeys in West Africa and Southeast Asia.
Animal–mosquito–animal with spillover to humans in epidemics via direct/indirect contact to infected animal tissue or mosquito bite.
By ingestion of contaminated food (honey in infant botulism), injection of contaminated drugs, or contamination of wounds by soil, dust or gravel. There is no human-to-human transmission.
Female phlebotomine sandflies (Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P.chadaudi, P. longipes, P. pedifer)
Microscopy (M’Fadyan stain) of lesion; bacterial culture of lesion, blood, or respiratory specimen; PCR; ELISA.
Obligate intracellular, pleomorphic bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae, which invade host leukocytes. Ehrlichia chaffeensis infects mononuclear phagocytes; E. ewingii and Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects neutrophils. E. canis may cause human disease in Venezuela. In 2009 an E. murislike organism was discovered in USA. Neorickettsia sennetsu causes Sennetsu fever.
Human.
Pneumococcal Disease
P. ovale initally was thought to be limited to Sub-Saharan Africa, Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and various parts of Southeast Asia. P. ovale has not yet been reported in South America. In general, P. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in West Africa prevalences above 10% are observed. Also, infections are most common in children <10 years. There is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. Due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, P. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
The most common clinical presentation for streptobacillosis is a triad of (1) relapsing fever, (2) severe, migratory polyarthralgias, and (3) a peripheral, hemorrhagic maculopapular rash. The most prominent symptom is severe myalgia with prostration. Polyarthralgias occur in two-thirds of reported cases. In spirillosis, the bite site becomes indurated and may ulcerate with regional lymphadenopathy; arthritic symptoms are rare. If untreated, the disease may progress to bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis, parotitis, tenosynovitis, and focal abscesses of soft tissues or the brain. CFR in untreated cases may be as much as 13%. There is a significant risk of streptobacillary endocarditis with associated CFR of 50%.
Intestinal capillariasis is generally found in countries where raw freshwater fish is eaten. The parasite was first reported in 1963 in the northern Philippines. C. philippinensisis endemic in the Philippines, Laos, and Thailand. Rare cases have been reported from other Asian countries and the Middle East. A single case has been reported in Spain imported from Colombia, but there are no other reports of cases in the Americas. Rare cases of human infection with C. hepatica and C. aerophila have been reportedworldwide. Infected fishmay be exported from endemic areas to non-endemic countries.
Detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or ELISA; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
The protein concentrates in tissues of the central nervous system. Prions are resistant to normal cooking temperatures and humans are thought to be infected by ingesting contaminated food. In contrast to other forms of human prion diseases, in vCJD significant levels of infectivity are found in the lymphoreticular system (lymph nodes, spleen, tonsil, and appendix).
Humans (mainly L. donovani), wild Canidae (foxes, raccoon dogs, jackals, wolves), domestic dogs (mainly L. infantum/chagasi), and rodents.
Usually 12–36 hours; sometimes several days; up to 2 weeks for wound botulism.
Anisakiasis, pseudaterranovosis, Cod worm disease, Herring worm disease, Whaleworm disease, and Sealworm disease.
Non-A non-B hepatitis, HCV infection.
Months to years.
Larval stage mites, so-called chiggers from the genus Leptotrombidium. A number of small rodents, particularly wild rats, are the natural hosts for scrub typhus without apparent disease.
The global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus, and occurs basically between the 10 C isotherms. Autochthonous dengue fever cases appeared in Europe for the first time in 2010, north of 10 C isotherm and likely transmitted by Ae. albopictus (see Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictus map). There is strong seasonality, correlated with the rainy season, which produces a marked increase in vectors because more mosquito-breeding sites become available then. Two, 3 or all 4 serotypes may occur concurrently. DHF/DSS in many countries is most often seen in children suffering a secondary infection with a different serotype. Incidence rates of up to 3% have been seen in dengue naõve populations such as are found in some Pacific islands.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
None.
Protection from vector bites by wearing permethrin-treated light-colored clothes and fly repellent on exposed skin. DEC can be used as prophylaxis, but should not be used routinely.
Enzyme immunoassay to detect anti HIV antibodies with confirmation by Western blot. Fourthgeneration HIV serology tests that consist of antibody detection and p24 antigen detection in combination are now commonly used. Also rapid tests are available for field testing. Viral load and HIV-1 p24 antigen may be used in some circumstances. CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load are used to monitor progression of infection. Genotypic and phenotypic tests are used for HIVdrug-resistance testing.
Humans, dogs, cats, pigs, and wild carnivores.

Strongyloidiasis
Microscopy of stained smear from a bubo, sputum or CSF shows characteristic ‘safety-pin’ shape; serology (IFA; ELISA); rapid dipstick test. Culture takes about 4 days.
SINV has been isolated from Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. The highest disease burden is in northern Europe (approximately between 60 and 64 N) and South Africa. Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America, with subsequent spread to North America, Asia, and Australia, with later spread to Europe and Africa. Intererestingly, there are high levels of gene sequence similarities of SINV isolates within the same north–south axis, which correlates with major bird migration patterns (see Bird Migration map). Preferred habitat is a wetland ecosystem. The disease is seasonal, coinciding with the period of mosquito abundance and reservoir presence. Overwintering in the northern hemisphere may be by vertical transmission in the vectors. In Scandinavia, most cases occur in July through September, when there is plenty of vector species. Peak incidence in Karelia is about one month after the peak in Finland. Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland, with the last epidemic in 2002. No epidemic occurred in 2009, probably due to a decline in the grouse population.
Rickettsia rickettsii, R. parkeri and R. africae, Gramnegative intracellular bacilli. R. rickettsii is the agent of RMSF, R. parkeri causes a RMSF-like illness. R. africae causes African tick bite fever and is rarely found in the new world. New agents are still being discovered regularly.
ICD-9 125.0, 125.1, 125.6; ICD-10 B74.0, B74.1, B74.2
Detection by RT-PCR on blood or swabs of nasopharyngeal mucosa; virus isolation from swabs, blood, or urine; detection of measles specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.); transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and blood transfusion.
Loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases. Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings (Calabar swellings) which are angiedemas. These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs, especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement. Less frequently: giant urticaria, arthritis, and fever. The adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye. Encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis. These SAEs mainly occur in those with heavy infection ( > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood).
Monkeypox virus (MPV), a double-stranded DNA virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus, family Poxviridae. Two clades of monkeypox viruses are known: the West African virus and the Congo Basin virus. The Congo Basin strain is more virulent than the West African strain. The MPV genome is > 96% identical to the variola virus genome. However, MPV is not a direct ancestor or descendent of variola virus.
Virus isolation in cell culture; RT-PCR; antigen detection; serology by IgM ELISA. The virus is a BSL-4 agent.
Mild disease: oral itraconazole or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. For severe cases: iv amphotericin B or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Treatment is long and is monitored by clinical and radiological signs.
Although SARS-like coronaviruses with very high genetic homology to SARS-CoV have been identified in masked palm civets, civets are thought to be a non-reservoir, spillover species. Horseshoe bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of the progenitor of the SARS virus.
Zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the Old World and is absent from the Americas (a single case in the USA was imported from Yap island). The competence of mosquitoes on the American continent for Zika virus is unknown. The geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases, mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys. Positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive, because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses. In 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73% of the population of Yap island. There were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak. Due to intense air travel in the Pacific region and presence of competent vectors, there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond. Adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years. Approximately 18% of individuals infected by the Zika virus develop symptoms; this is similar to that reported for West Nile virus infection.
ICD-9 9055.0; ICD-10 B05
H. capsulatum grows in soil and material contaminated with bird or guano. The fungus has been found in poultry house litter, caves, areas harboring bats and in bird roosts. Histoplasma capsulatum is found throughout the world excluding areas of very low and very high rainfall. It is endemic in certain areas of the United States, particularly in states bordering the Ohio river valley and the lower Mississippi river, where 90% of the population have positive histoplasmin skin tests, indicating a large amount of asymptomatic infection. H. capsulatum var. duboisii is common in caves in southern and East Africa. Infection can occur outside the cave entrance without entering. Infants, young children, and older persons, in particular those with chronic lung disease, are at increased risk for severe disease. Disseminated disease is more frequently seen in people with cancer, AIDS or other forms of immunosuppression.
ICD-9 127.2; ICD-10 B78
Pentavalent antimonials; pentamidine; amphotericin. Other drugs and regimens are being tested (including paramomycin, miltefosine).
Tick to mammalian host to tick for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma; trematode to aquatic host to trematode for Neorickettsia. Human is a dead-end host for all. During the eclipse phase of both HME and HGA infection, the blood remains potentially infectious by blood transfusion.
Supportive.
Humans.
German measles
Hepatitis B is a common disease world wide, despite the existence of a vaccine. The WHO estimates that globally 2 billion individuals have been infected, of which about 360 million have chronic disease. Yearly, it is estimated that there are 500,000 to 700,000 HBV associated deaths world wide. In high-endemic regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon basin, most individuals become infected during childhood (mother-to-child, or child-to-child). In developed regions, the prevalence is low and important routes of transmission are different, consisting mostly of unsafe sexual practices, IVDU, and occupational transmission in healthcare workers. Chronic HBV associated liver cirrhosis is more common in developed nations than in Southeast Asia, but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is lower compared to Southeast Asia. It is not yet fully clear whether this is due to differences in HBV genotype or age of infection.
Often asymptomatic in healthy individuals. Symptomatic cases: fever, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and jaundice, hemolytic anemia; severe cases: retinal infarctions, ecchymoses and petechiae, acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, DIC, liver and renal failure, and splenic rupture, with a mortality rate of 5–9%, higher in immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria, Lyme disease, or human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
Tetracycline, doxyxyline. Alternative: chloramphenicol.
Humans are the definitive host; pigs are an intermediate host.
Streptococcus suis, a Gram-positive alpha-hemolytic bacterium, with 35 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. The predominant one causing human disease is serotype 2.
ICD-10 A92.9
Proper cooking, or freezing of fish at 20 C for 7 days destroys the parasite. Abandon use of human feces to fertilize fish ponds.
Measles has a worldwide distribution, but is eliminated from the western hemisphere through vaccination. Measles deaths world wide fell by 78% from an estimated 733,000 in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008; all regions but one have achieved the United Nations goal of reducing measles mortality by 90%, however, it remains the leading cause of vaccinepreventable deaths in children and there are fears of a resurgence if vaccination falters for lack of resources. WHO figures for 2008 were 282,000 reported cases, with many thousands more unreported. Some 58% of countries have 90% or more vaccine coverage, adequate to stop transmission, but endemic countries have case fatality rates of up to 30% in places. Most measles deaths ( > 95%) occur in countries with a per capita income of <US$ 1,000. Measles-free countries still have imported cases and limited outbreaks in subpopulations with low or no vaccination coverage (e.g. religious communities). Measles is being considered for global elimination or even eradication.
Schistosomiasis, Asia
Rotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus within the Reoviridae family, is classified into 7 rotavirus groups (A–G) as determined by the antigenic properties of the VP6 capsid protein. Group A is most common in human disease, with B and C to a lesser extent. Subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes P and G, of the VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins, respectively. These proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy.
The disease is limited geographically to the range of the vector tick. Hyalomma spp. do not occur in the Americas and Oceania. Historically the tick does not appear above 50 N latitude, but possibly due to changes in climate and environment the tick and CCHFV outbreaks have occurred above this latitude. In the northern hemisphere, H. marginatum becomes more active by increasing temperatures during spring (April–May) and immature stages are active from May to September. The potential roles of migratory birds and the movement of livestock carrying ticks in the spread of the virus are unclear. CCHFV outbreaks mainly occur in those working in agricultural areas. About 90% of the cases in a recent outbreak in Turkey were farmers. Cases regularly had skin contact with livestock or other animals. Also outdoor activities (hiking, camping) in endemic areas are a risk factor. Countries on the map marked as having no data (western Sahara, Palestine, parts of the Arabian peninsula, Kashmir) are within the range of the vector tick and likely at risk for CCHFV outbreaks. CCHFV genotypes cluster geographically, with exceptions: the Asia 1 genotype has been found in Madagascar, where it was possibly introduced by migrating birds, and Africa 1 in the Middle East, which may have been introduced with infected livestock.
Rickettsia aeschlimannii, R. africae (ATBF), R. australis (QTT), R. conorii caspia (AF), R. conorii conorii (MSF), R. conorii indica (ITT), R. conorii israelensis (ISF), R. helvetica, R. honei (FISF), R. japonica (JSF/OSF), R. massiliae, R. sibirica (STT/ NATT), Gram-negative intracellular bacilli. New agents are still being discovered regularly.
Praziquantel and niclosamide are the drugs of choice. In untreated cases the worms can live up to 25 years and produce eggs.
Dengue-like fever with headache, malaise, arthralgia or myalgia for about 2 to 5 days; occasionally nausea and vomiting, lower limb weakness, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a rash. The fever resolves in a few days; the disease is non-fatal.
The multi-mammate rat (Mastomys natalensis), which lives in houses and surrounding fields. Previous studies that identified M. erythroleucus and M. huberti as reservoirs may have confused the species. M. natalensis is generally absent in coastal West Africa.
The primary vectors are ticks and biting flies (deer flies, tabanids). In central Europe: Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus are important vectors. In eastern USA, D. variabilis is the most important vector. In western USA, biting flies are the predominant vectors in arid regions. In Russia, transmission is both by ticks (Ixodes) and mosquitoes.
The agent of intestinal capillariasis is Capillaria philippinensis (or Paracapillaria philippinensis), a small nematode roundworm (males 2.3 to 3.2mm; females 2.5 to 4.3 mm). Two other Capillaria species that can cause rare human infections: The agent of intestinal capillariasis is Capillaria philippinensis (or Paracapillaria philippinensis), a small nematode roundworm (males 2.3 to 3.2mm; females 2.5 to 4.3 mm).

Supportive, there is no specific polio treatment.
Katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis, caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain. Katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals (e.g. travelers) and relatively rare among local residentswith exposure since childhood. S. japonicum causes intestinal schistosomiasis with: diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, hepatosplenomegaly. Chronic infection leads to liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, anemia, and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children; seizures due to egg granulomas in brain or spinal cord. Infection does not produce full immunity, so reinfection occurs. S.mekongi causes similar, but milder, disease compared to S. japonicum.
6–21 days, usually 7–12 days.
Infective sporozoites are inoculated by bite from anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites, or to a dormant stage (hypnozoite) that can become active after months or years, causing relapse. Merozoites released from liver mostly infect reticulocytes that develop to schizonts, rupture and release merozoites that will infect new reticulocytes (this cycle takes 48 hours). Gametocytes are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal.
Parasite, kinetoplastida. Leishmania donovani and its subspecies donovani and infantum. L. chagasi is considered to be the same species asL.infantum, and are referred to asL.infantum/ chagasi. Occasionally, other Leishmania spp. can cause visceral disease, usually in immunocompromised individuals.
Fasciolopsiasis
The highest global burden of CL is in the Old World. In the Americas, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru have the highest burden of CL. In the New World, CL mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the Old World it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. Transmision can also occur in deforested areas. Disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. Outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. Also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
California encephalitis, Jamestown Canyon encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis.
Varying from 4 to 45 days.
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe, where its incidence is increasing. Incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. The three Borrelia species differ in geographic location, vectors, and clinical manifestations: B. burgdorferi ss is present both in North America and Europe, but is absent from Asia; B. garinii andB. afzelii occur in Europe and Asia. A recent study showed that B. garinii is the main genotype in China. Data of B. burgdorferi presence are lacking for South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia. In the USA the disease is focal: most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions. In the Baltic region, disease rates are several fold higher than in the USA. Incidences vary, ranging from 0.3/ 100,000 in the UK to 130/100,000 in Austria. Climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases. None of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in Australia.
From a few hours up to 3 days.
Primarily Old World fruit-eating bats, mainly in the family Pteropodidae.
Trench fever, quintana fever, quintan fever, shinbone fever, shank fever, His-Werner disease, and Wolhynia fever.
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
Domestic and free living ungulates (cattle, sheep, and goats). Also found in other livestock, birds, pets (cats and dogs), and ticks. Infected animals are generally asymptomatic, but infection may lead to late abortion.
Western Equine Encephalitis
Consumption, white plague, TB.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment
Zika Fever
Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative bacillus. S. Typhi belongs to Salmonella serogroup D and possesses somatic antigen O9, a single flagellar antigen Hd, and virulence antigen Vi. S. Paratyphi A can cause similar disease.
Most infections produce few or no symptoms. Acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. The entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (Romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. After a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. Variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. Group I T. cruzi, rare north of the Amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. Group IIT. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. AIDS patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. CFR from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.
2–10 weeks to primary lesion or tuberculin-positive skin test; around 10% progresses to active disease annually, but it may remain latent for decades to lifelong,. This percentage is higher in children and in HIV-infected or otherwise immune-suppressed individuals.
Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous and Mucosal, New World
Access to clean water and sanitation; regular deworming; use of closed footwear. Infection control in immunocompromised patients with hyperinfection. Immunocompromised patients who have been in endemic areas should be screened and treated if positive.
Anisakidosis occurs world wide, mainly in coastal regions, and in cultures where consumption of raw fish occurs. Risky fish dishes are sushi, sashimi, Filipino bagoong, salted or smoked herring, gravlax, Hawaiian lomi-lomi and palu, South American ceviche, and Spanish pickled anchovies. Anisakidosis is increasingly common in western European countries and the USA due to the increasing popularity of eating raw fish (usually Sashimi). In the USA most cases are related to Pacific salmon consumption and in Europe to herring consumption. It is unclear why anisakidosis is common in Japan, but rarely reported in Taiwan or coastal China where similar fish products are eaten. Overall there is underdiagnosis of the disease due to the physicians’ inexperience of the disease. Pseudoterranovosis (codworm) is relatively more common in North America than in Europe or Japan. Most allergic cases are reported from Mediterranean Europe. In Spain it is mainly related to the consumption of cooked hake and anchovies.
