human-deer-fly-human. after infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. in the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. an infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
s. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. free-living filariform (l3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. in the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (l1) are excreted. these non-infectious (l1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (l3) larvae. some non-infectious l1 larvae may develop faster into infectious l3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. this process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.

rotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded rna virus within the reoviridae family, is classified into 7 rotavirus groups (a–g) as determined by the antigenic properties of the vp6 capsid protein. group a is most common in human disease, with b and c to a lesser extent. subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes p and g, of the vp4 and vp7 outer capsid proteins, respectively. these proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy.
mosquito-host-mosquito. the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host. depending on ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. e. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.

world wide there are approximately 1.5 million new cases of cl per year, with most cases reported from afghanistan, algeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and syria in the old world. the highest burden of cl in the old word is in rural semi-arid and desert regions, but transmission is being increasingly seen in peri-urban and urban environments. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is likely related to the short flight range of sandflies.
the disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis a disease. children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. in immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.

b. quintana multiplies in the louse’s intestine and is excreted in the feces. body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching, by which the skin is inoculated with louses’ contaminated feces. chronic b. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread.
sars presents initially with fever, headache, myalgia, and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray. gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early sars illness. case fatality is around 10%, and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults.
hookworm morbidity is higher in patients infected with large numbers of adult parasites. attachment of the hookworm to the intestinal mucosa results in loss of blood, eventually resulting in anemia and malnutrition in chronic cases. chronic hookworm infection can impair cognitive and growth development in children.

lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease that can affect the skin, heart, nervous system and, less commonly, the eyes, kidneys, and liver. often there is an annular skin rash that develops at the bite site, known as em. after several months, approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection will have intermittent arthritis. up to 5% of untreated patients develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection. re-infection can occur.
it is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in africa, and remaining in small foci in central and south america and yemen. onchocerciasis was imported into latin america by the slave trade. onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. this variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
non-human primates in africa and humansin asia; asianmonkeys can be infected, but do not seem to constitute an important reservoir. during intra-epidemic periods, several vertebrates have been implicated as potential reservoirs.
humans are the main reservoir; non-human primates can be infected, rarely.

mosquitoes. in north america, the primary vector of weev for the enzootic cycle is culex tarsalis. weev is transmitted to humans and horses by bridging mosquitoes (e.g. ochlerotatus melanimon and aedes species).
respiratory diphtheria is classically associated with fever, inflammation of the pharynx or larynx, pseudomembrane formation, lymphadenopathy and edema of the soft tissues of the neck. however, most cases are mild and may resemble streptococcal pharyngitis and the pseudomembrane may be absent. the exotoxin of c. diphtheriae can cause polyneuritis and myocarditis. nasal diphtheria is usually mild and chronic with nasal discharge and ulceration. cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic, sharply demarcated ulcers with an adherent gray pseudomembrane. it is usually associated with skin infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococci.
hares, hedgehogs, wild mice, livestock, ostriches. since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially, ticks also serve as reservoirs.
in early and limited disease: 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin. for more extensive disease: rifampicin plus streptomycin for 8 weeks; extensive lesions may require reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy. lesions < 5cm can be excised under local anesthetic.
among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. the cfr is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed c. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. the motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. when ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. the cycle takes approximately 3 months.
mosquito–reservoir animal–mosquito. humans are dead-end hosts. equines (horses, mules, and donkeys) are amplifying hosts for the epidemic subtypes of veev, with high viremias that can infect a wide range of mosquitoes. half of infected equids die from veev. viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds and 3 days in equids. extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days.

there is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses. group c viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the americas, and were first described in the brazilian amazon in the 1950s. studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts, leading to genetic reassortment. genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the americas. nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported, from mexico to brazil. there is no sex or age preference for infection. inapparent and mild infections are common, overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas.
not completely understood. possibly in the soil the fungus produces infective propagula that can become airborne, inhaled, and lead to respiratory infection. infections may also occur through traumatic lesions, but this has not been demonstrated.

hme, hga: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. hme cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. reinfection can occur. cfr is 2.7% for hme, <1% for hga, and absent for e. ewingii infection.
wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. hyraxes for l. aethiopica.
serology is mainly used (immunodiffusion and cf tests). detection of antigen in blood, csf, urine or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by radioimmunoassay. microscopy on giemsa stained bone-marrow or blood smear. histoplasma skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed. pcr-based tests are available. fungal culture is generally slow.
microscopy of stool specimens cannot distinguish between e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii, and e. dispar; pcr is able to distinguish between these species; stool antigen tests can identify e. histolytica. 
sanitation to avoid contamination of vector snail habitat with human or animal feces. improve water drainage, use molluscicides and avoid eating uncooked aquatic plants in endemic areas and drinking untreated water.
plasmodium falciparum, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the phylum apicomplexa. among the malaria parasites, p. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality.
filarial nematode (roundworm), loa loa. adult worms are nematodes that live freely in subcutaneous tissue. adult females are 40–70 mm long and males are 30–34mm long.
taeniosis is t. solium infection of the small intestine and varies from asymptomatic (the most frequent) to weight loss, anorexia and abdominal pain. cysticercosis is a tissue infection with t. solium larvae with findings depending on where cysticerci develop (subcutaneous, eye, heart, cns). its localization in the cns, causing neurocysticercosis, is the most severe form of the disease: seizures, headache, focal neurologic signs, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus may develop. the cfr is low.
clonorchis sinensis, a trematode (fluke) 10–25 mm long and 3–5 mm wide.
crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host, excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues, usually the lungs. there they encapsulate, mature, and lay eggs. eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed, then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2–4 weeks into miracidia larvae. these penetrate the body of the vector snail, where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish.
doxycycline for 6 weeks, in combination with either rifampicin for 6 weeks, or streptomycin for 2–3 weeks, or gentamicin for 1–2 weeks.
rotavirus antigen detection by eia and other serological techniques; rt-pcr.
it is estimated that more than 207 million people are infected world wide, with 85% of them in africa. infection does not produce full immunity, so reinfection occurs. schistosomiasis is a water-based disease that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to irrigation projects or dams. man-made water bodies like dams can lead to changes in snail habitat and cause a shift from urogenital to intestinal schistosomiasis (egypt) and vice versa (senegal). s. mansoni was presumably introduced with the slave trade from west africa into south america and the caribbean s. intercalatum and s. guineensis are geographically restricted to central western africa.
c. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions. the organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months. prevention is targeted to those working with livestock, mainly sheep and goats; appropriate disposal of birth products; routine testing of risk animals; restricted movement of animals in infected regions; culling of infected animals; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries; pasteurize milk.
klebsiella granulomatis, formerly calymmatobacterium granulomatis, a gram-negative facultative aerobic coccobacillus.
by tick bites, except for n. sennetsu, which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts. no person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion.
foxes (including urban foxes) are the definitive hosts, wild rodents (mainly arvicolidae), voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts. foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas, partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination.
mosquito species that breedin rice fields and marshes, principally culex tritaenorhynchus group; also c. gelidus and c. vishnui.
humans. cattle and other livestock may harbor c. ulcerans
undetermined. thought to be forest rodents (squirrels, rats, mice, dormice), shrews and monkeys in the rainforests of west and central africa.
inhalation of arthroconidia (reproductive spores) from the environment or dusty fomites. sometimes through direct inoculation or transplantation. person-to-person transmission is extremely rare.
tree-hole-breeding forest mosquitoes: aedes spp. in africa, and haemagogus and sabethes spp. in south america. transovarian transmission occurs in the mosquito and may be the way the virus survives in the years between cycles. the urban vector on both continents is aedes aegypti.
serology (igm and igg elisa) on acute and convalescent sera; cross-reactivity exists leading to misidentification. rt-pcr has been used to test human brain tissue samples.
vaccination of children with three doses of hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months, with a booster dose aged 12–15 months. since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive hib disease are at increased risk of disease, rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years.
streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an encapsulated gram-positive bacterium, with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90% if the infections in the developed world.
humans.
cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and fever can develop when the worms move through the lungs. in about 5 to 14 days the larvae reach the central nervous system, leading to subacute meningitis. eosinophilic meningitisis defined asmeningitiswith > 10 eosinophils/ml in csf or at least 10% eosinophils in the total csf leukocyte count. some caseshavelow-grade fever and temporary facial paralysis. signs of raised intracranial pressure, like diplopia. worms occasionallyenter theeye.thecourse of theillnessranges from a fewdays to several months. death is rare.
main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
strongyloides stercoralis, a minute nematode roundworm (up to2.2 mmlong). s.fuelleborni (not shown on the map) is a less common agent and can causehuman diseasein africa and papua new guinea (‘swollen belly syndrome’ in infants).
ebola viruses, except restv, are endemic in the tropical rain forests of equatorial africa. most outbreaks started from a single case admitted to a hospital that had inadequate infection control, resulting in rapid nosocomial transmission. cases have been imported from endemic countries into south africa and switzerland, and laboratory infections have occurred in the uk and russia. marburg viruses are endemic in arid woodlands of equatorial africa. outbreaks are usually limited to a few cases, with the exception of one outbreak in the drc and angola. cases have been imported into south africa, the netherlands, and possibly the usa. a laboratory outbreak in 1967 in germany and in yugoslavia, led to the discovery of the disease (not shown on the map).
characterized by high fever of 2–7 days alternating with afebrile periods of 4–14 days, relapsing up to 13 times. initial symptoms include generalized body aches, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, chills, sweats, and a transitory rash. later symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dry cough, photophobia, neck pain, conjunctivitis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, confusion; rarely hematuria and epistaxis. long-term sequelae of tbrf include cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities, ophthalmia and abortion. lbrf is generally more severe than tbrf, but associated with fewer relapses.
avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. an inactivated vaccine is available. specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
uncomplicated malaria: acute febrile illness with headache, chills, sweats, nausea, and vomiting; hepatosplenomegaly. findings of severe malaria can be: cerebral malaria (confusion, seizures, impaired consciousness to coma), hemolysis, severe anemia, hypotension, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and death. often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria ( > 5% infected erythrocytes).
intestinal capillariasis starts with mild abdominal pain, borborygmus, and diarrhea, that develops to profuse watery diarrhea. if untreated: chronic diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption, leading to weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia, and eventually death. hepatic capillariasis (c. hepatica) is a (sub)acute hepatitis with eosinophilia, that may disseminate to other organs and can be fatal. pulmonary capillariasis (c. aerophila) may present with fever, cough, asthma, and pneumonia and may also be fatal.
humans.
bat to bat via unknown route. humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts.
microscopy for eggs in stool smear (kato–katz technique) is often inconclusive due to the similarity to eggs of other trematodes. intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but not specific. immunodiagnosis is regarded supportive but not confirmatory. radiology to demonstrate bile duct pathology. pcr test for o. viverrini is available.
spherical, enveloped orthobunyaviruses with single-stranded, negative-sense, tripartite rna genomes, with con-siderable recognized reassortment. the name derives from the original classification of arthropod-borne viruses in to a, b and c groups. group c viruses can be divided into four complexes: (1) caraparu complex [apeu virus (apeuv), bruconha virus (brcv), caraparu virus (carv), ossa virus (ossav), and vinces virus (vinv)]; (2) madrid virus (madv); (3) marituba complex viruses [gumbo limbo virus (glv), marituba virus (mtbv), murutucu virus (murv), nepuyo virus (nepv), restan virus (resv)], and (4) oriboca complex viruses [itaqui (itqv), oriboca viruses (oriv)].
