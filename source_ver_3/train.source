healthy humans can carry s. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract.
brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. from infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder: fever, headache, myalgia, backache, lymphadenopathy (not seen in smallpox), malaise, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body; the lesions eventually crust and fall off. the outcome can be fatal (cfr: 1–10%).

culiseta melanura: bird to bird; aedes or coquillettidia spp.: from bird to other vertebrates (including horses and humans). viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds, and the extrinsic cycle in mosquitoes lasts 2–3 days. horses and humans are dead-end hosts because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
supportive treatment; ribavirin. junin convalescent serum reduces the cfr of argentinian hemorrhagic fever to <1%.
the diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features. the bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis.
west nile virus (wnv), a flavivirus, with an envelope and rna plus-strand genome. sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes has resulted in a division of wnv strains into four distinct lineages, with lineage 1 strains further separatedinto three clades (1a, 1b, and 1c). kunjin virus and murray valley encephalitis virus are subtypes of wnv that are endemic in parts of oceania.

weil disease, swamp fever, cane cutters disease, hemorrhagic jaundice, swineherd disease.
microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. in humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
sudden onset of fever (which may be biphasic), malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins and marked anorexia; occasionally vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. hemorrhage in oropharynx, nose, lungs, uterus, intestines; hematomas, echymosis, and petechiae; hematuria and albuminuria. in russia, estimates are that only 1 in 6 cases is hemorrhagic. the cfr ranges from 2 to 80% in different countries.
summer diarrhea, acute diarrhea.
supportive with pain management.
wild, migratory birds of the order passeriformes (mainlyfieldfare, redwing, and songthrush) and anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). tetraonid birds (grouse) population size changes coincide with sinv epidemics in finland. larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species.
ingestion of raw or undercooked fish. there is no person-to-person transmission.
repeated re-infection with chlamydia trachomatis serovars a, b, ba, and c, an obligate intracellular bacterium. the genital serovars d to k can infect the conjunctiva, but generally do not lead to blindness as they cause self-limited infections that typically do not recur.
bairnsdale ulcer (southern australia), daintree ulcer (northern australia) kumusi ulcer (papua new guinea), searl ulcer.
penicillium marneffei, a dimorphic fungus. it is the only penicillium species that is dimorphic: at body temperature or 37 c it is a yeast form and at cooler temperature it grows as a mold.

prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. treat close contacts. there has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofwho and with material support from unicef in the 1950s and 1960s.
animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
by tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. the virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.

standard anti-mosquito precautions.
blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph ajellomyces dermatitidis), a dimorphic fungus: grows as a pathogenic yeast at body temperature and as a mold in the environment.
the natural reservoir is unclear. the fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (dasypus novemcinctus). the disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. as armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. by using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of p. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
the estimated prevalence of strongyloidiasis is between 30 and 100 million infections in 70 countries world wide; however, the accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to poor performance of screening methods. most cases are found in tropical and subtropical areas (warm, moist). rarely, it is found in foci in north america and europe. it is of significance in developed nations as it can cause hyperinfection in immunocompromised patients that have been infected years before in an endemic region. the most important risk factor for hyperinfection is corticosteroid therapy; other risk factors are: hematologic malignancies, malnutrition, alcoholism, htlv-1 infection, and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplantation). interestingly, hyperinfection is not commonly seen in hiv-infected individuals in endemic countries.
the majority of the cases (70–80%) are asymptomatic. sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and upset, nausea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and frequently a maculopapular rash. less than 1% of infected persons develop neuroinvasive disease. neurological disorders are more frequent in the elderly and immunocompromised, and may be fatal, with the exception of the kunjin strain. after 5 years 60% of patients who presented with neuroinvasive disease continued to report weakness, fatigue, memory loss, and ataxia.
drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. there is an up to 10% relapse rate.

primary hiv infection is usually a nonspecific illness with fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and a sore throat. generalized lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash may occur. following primary infection there is a prolonged asymptomatic period before the appearance of the clinical manifestations of a loss of immune control over infectious pathogens and cancers. common presenting aids defining illnesses are tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, recurrent bacterial infections, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis, kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, and cmv disease.
supportive.
contamination of a break in the skin by bacilli in the environment, or by the bite of an infected aquatic insect or mosquito. person-to-person transmission is rare.
clinical presentation depends on level of immune suppression. p. marneffei is most often an opportunistic infection in hiv patients with low cd4 counts (<100 cells/m l). most present with fever and typical skin lesions. other findings are anemia, generalized lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. respiratory signs can also be observed. skin lesions are often papules with central necrosis on the face and neck, but other body sites can also have lesions. other opportunistic infections also need to be excluded in these patients.

human t-lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1), a type c retrovirus with at least 6 subtypes. the virus was isolated for the first time in the usa in 1980, before hiv-1 (also a retrovirus) was discovered in 1983. genomically, simian t-lymphotropic virus (stlv) isolates cluster closely with htlv-1 in the same region, suggesting simian-to-human transmission at multiple occasions.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
pigs or humans ingest eggs from contaminated environment. adult tapeworms will only develop in humans after eating raw or undercooked pork containing cysticerci. it takes 2 months for larvae to become an adult worm and produce eggs (up to 300,000 eggs per day). in pigs, eggs invade the general circulation via the intestinal wall and migrate to skeletal and heart muscles where they form cysticerci.
malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the thai–cambodian border region. uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts); the choice of acts is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an act or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.

the tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. as the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
range from asymptomatic pulmonary consolidation to mild bronchitis, through acute pneumonic or rapidly fatal septicemic presentations to chronic suppurative infection. pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and empyema may also be seen. easily confused clinically with typhoid fever and tuberculosis, and laboratories may not recognize the causative organism and report it as a contaminant.
through breaks in skin, ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated dust. there are rare reports of transmission from human or animal cases to humans. laboratory workers have been infected by aerosols.
sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, and headache, followed by pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. severe cases have internal and external hemorrhages, cns involvement and multi-organ failure leading to terminal shock. the case fatality rate (cfr) varies, depending on location, virus involved, and clinical care: 0% for restv and tafv, 34% for bdbv; 78% for ebov, 53% for sudv, 82% for marv. recovery may be prolonged and accompanied by long term sequelae, particularly hearing loss. filoviruses can persist for months and disease may recur.
wildlife–tick–wildlife. the tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. the virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
early phase: rt-pcr on blood; serology (igm and igg), but there is cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses; positive serology requires confirmation by more specific tests, like plaque-reduction assay.
self-limiting disease. sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. patients eventually recover completely.

majority will be asymptomatic in the acute phase, but approximately 80% develops chronic hcv disease. acute disease: insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, nausea, malaise and vomiting; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine. most infected cases (approx. 80%) develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom; 20–30% even-tually develop severe liver disease: cirrhosis and liver cancer (may take 20 years and is dependent on the presence of other risk factors). hcv infection is an important cause for liver transplantation in developed countries. there is accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of hepato-cellular carcinoma in: men, elderly, obese, alcoholics, those infected with hiv or hepatitis b virus.
the global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus, and occurs basically between the 10 c isotherms. autochthonous dengue fever cases appeared in europe for the first time in 2010, north of 10 c isotherm and likely transmitted by ae. albopictus (see aedes agypti and aedes albopictus map). there is strong seasonality, correlated with the rainy season, which produces a marked increase in vectors because more mosquito-breeding sites become available then. two, 3 or all 4 serotypes may occur concurrently. dhf/dss in many countries is most often seen in children suffering a secondary infection with a different serotype. incidence rates of up to 3% have been seen in dengue naõve populations such as are found in some pacific islands.
mosquitoes: culex and culiseta spp. between birds, aedes spp. from bird to human.
the louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics, with a cfr of 30–70%; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease, with a cfr of 2–10%. lbrf has disappeared from europe; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide, except in australia and new zealand, and is rare in europe and north america. human tbrf is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals. otherwise, the disease is sporadic. lbrf is now found sporadically in epidemics in africa, and is associated with refugee camps, natural disasters, and famine. lbrf used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars. it may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations.
most infections produce few or no symptoms. acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. the entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. after a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. group i t. cruzi, rare north of the amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. group iit. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. aids patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. cfr from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.
probably bird–mosquito–bird. mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic reservoir birds. this is followed by an extrinsic cycle of a few days in the mosquito, with subsequent transmission to birds or humans by bite. humans are a dead-end host. there is evidence for vertical (transovarial) transmission in mosquitoes.

the highest global burden of cl is in the old world. in the americas, bolivia, brazil, and peru have the highest burden of cl. in the new world, cl mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the old world it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. transmision can also occur in deforested areas. disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
humans are the main reservoir. subclinical infection is likely common in endemic areas, as m. leprae dna can be found in nasal swabs in up to 5% of healthy individuals in asian endemic regions. subclinical infection generally does not develop into clinical disease. natural infection occurs in armadillos and several primates.

a generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs. postauricular, occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5–10 days. around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children. arthropathy may occur, especially in young women. the most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (crs), which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy. crs is a severe disease characterized by deafness, cataract, cardiac abnormalities, and a range of neurological impairments.
forest rodents, marsupials, and bats.
about 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
direct contact with sick or dead poultry (most common) infected with hpai, and possibly via inhalation of virus-laden particles or contact of contaminated material with the eyes or respiratory mucosa. other postulated routes: ingestion of water contaminated with the feces of infected birds, consumption of undercooked products from infected birds. often, however, the route of exposure is not clear. limited person-to-person transmission of hpai h5n1 is possible following prolonged close contact with an infected patient.
