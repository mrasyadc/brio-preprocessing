there is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito. the mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites, which, after release, infect erythrocytes. the erythrocytic stages multiply around 10-fold every 48-hours. erythrocytes can release gametocytes which infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. in the mosquito, gametocytes develop into sporozoites.
ticks introduce babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. the sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. the gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
tabanid and stomoxys flies and mosquitoes can transmit, but are not epizootic vectors. blow-flies can also spread the bacteria.

often asymptomatic in healthy individuals. symptomatic cases: fever, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and jaundice, hemolytic anemia; severe cases: retinal infarctions, ecchymoses and petechiae, acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, dic, liver and renal failure, and splenic rupture, with a mortality rate of 5–9%, higher in immunocompromised patients. the differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria, lyme disease, or human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
rabies can manifest itself in two general forms: classic encephalitic (furious) rabies and paralytic (dumb) rabies. both forms are progressive and generally lead to death. the majority of the cases present as encephalitic rabies, with hydrophobia and hyperexcitability. paralytic rabies presents with flaccid muscle weakness or as febrile encephalopathy. in some papers, a third form, non-classic atypical rabies, is described.
microscopy of sputum smear or material from lesions can show characteristic budding forms of the fungus; culture; serology is not routinely used.
supportive, there is no specific treatment. ribavirin may limit the severity and improve the prognosis of lacv infections. anticonvulsant medication in those with seizures.
must be done in bsl-4 facilities if samples contain infectious virus. igm elisa, rt-pcr and virus isolation can be used on acute specimens; in convalescence, antibody tests; on autopsy specimens, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
orientia tsutsugamushi, obligate intracellular bacterium, before 1995 known as rickettsia tsutsugamushi. in 2010, a new species that can cause scrub typhus was discovered in dubai, o. chuto.
blood culture with prolonged incubation (42 days); lysis centrifugation blood culture systems or subculture of blood culture bottles onto fresh chocolate agar enhances sensitivity. several serological assays are available (cft, elisa, ifa), but cross-reactivity occurs; pcr on blood and tissue.
doxycycline; erythromycin for pregnant women; alternatives are ceftriaxone, norfloxacin and trovofloxacin; in cases of no response: gentamicin; surgery in advanced cases.
screening blood and blood products before use, bottle-feeding (20% of breast-fed infants of infected mothers become infected), using condoms. counseling and education of ivdus to implement harm reduction practices.
streptomycin, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides are standard; alternatives are gentamicin and fluoroquinolones. chloramphenicol in cases of plague meningitis. treatment should be started within 18 hours of onset. buboes may need to be drained.
immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
personal anti-insect measures; there is no vaccine. removal of culicoides breeding sites in cacao husks and felled banana trunks.
pcr on blood or skin biopsy, or ifa on the latter. serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
the parasite isingested by a tsetse fly during feeding on an infected host, and enters the salivary glands after 12–30 days, and can be transmitted to new susceptible hosts during the life of the fly (3 months). there is no vertical transmission in the fly.
there are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban. all three cycles exist in africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in south america. the sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes, and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work. the intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of africa, resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements. urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population (mainly aedes aegypti), that subsequently can transmit to other humans.
there are two different groups of etiologic agents: fungi and bacteria. fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma, and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated. the fungi madurella mycetomatis and pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma. bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated, of which the bacterial species of nocardia, streptomyces and actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma.
cyclops spp., microscopic copepods (crustaceans) commonly known as water fleas.
rodents, voles (b. microti), cattle (b. divergens), lagomorphs (b.divergens-like), possibly horses (b. duncani, formerly type wa1), or sheep (babesia type ko1).
gastric anisakidosis: findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed. gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis. intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, peritonitis, ulceration, and bleeding. anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis. pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom.
several species of paragonimus trematode flatworms: p. westermani, p. heterotremus, p. miyazakii, p. skrjabini, and p. hueitungensis (the last two may be the same) in asia, p. africanus and p. uterobilateralis in africa, p. mexicanus (p. peruvianus) and p. kellicotti in the americas.
virus detection by rt-pcr of respiratory specimens is recommended; virus culture requires a bsl-3 facility. microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to a/h5n1. rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity.
cutaneous anthrax: penicillin, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po; severe anthrax (gi or inhalation): ciprofloxacin iv preferred. clindamycin can inhibit toxin production.
monkey–mosquito–monkey; p. knowlesi has a short (24-hour) asexual lifeycle; humans are incidental hosts.
serology; there is no serological test that can distinguish between t. pallidum and the non-venereal t. pallidum subspecies. definitively diagnosis by pcr and sequencing.
two or more doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are necessary for protection. global coverage with three doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are shown elsewhere (see dtp3 map). infants under the age of 3–5 months are, depending on the vaccination schedule, too young to have received two doses and are also vulnerable to complications of pertussis. this group therefore suffers the greatest burden of pertussis mortality. post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic may be recommended for contacts in households where there is a susceptible member (e.g. an infant).
a combination of several arvs is recommended, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections, general measures to maintain nutrition and health, and treatment of specific infections or hiv-associated disorders.
snails, slugs, and land planarians. the giant african snail, achatina fulica, is the major source of infection world wide; but has been replaced by the imported south american golden apple snail, pomacea canaliculata, in taiwan and mainland china.
humans for t. b. gambiense; livestock and wildlife for t. b. rhodesiense. vector: tsetse fly (glossina). the main human vectors belong to the palpalis (riverine flies) and morsitans (forest and savannah flies) complex. the palpalis complex (g. fuscipes, g. palpalis, g. tachinoides) mainly transmit t. b. gambiense and the morsitans complex (g. morsitans, g. pallidipes, g. swynnertoni) mainly transmit t. b. rhodesiense. g. fuscipes and g. tachinoides can transmit both subspecies.
veldt sore (cutaneous diphtheria).
amebiasis, amebic dysentery, amebic liver abscess, ameboma, amoebiasis.
through contact with infectious respiratory droplets or saliva.
eating contaminated water plants. there is no person-to-person transmission.
