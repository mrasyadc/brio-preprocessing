Visualizing characteristic eggs in feces or duodenal fluid by microscopy.
Hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
By mosquito bite. Experiments demonstrated human to human transmission with the mosquito as vector, but there is no direct human-to-human transmission.
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR; serology (IgM ELISA); virus culture.
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe, sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. Furthermore, in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. Individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. Since S. suis is often misidentified, S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
LBRF is not transmitted by the bite itself but by feces or louse gut fluid entering broken skin by scratching. TBRF: by bite or coxal fluid of infected ticks. Transmission may also occur through blood transfusion or transplacental,
Blastomycosis
Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, or penicillins for 7 days have all been shown to be effective for treating TBRF. LBRF can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics. When initiating antibiotic therapy, watch closely for a Jarisch– Herxheimer reaction.
Acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting. Usually does not last longer than 2 weeks.
Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan, with a flagellate form in the bloodstream and an intracellular form without flagellum.
Tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection: ulceroglandular (commonest), glandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, oculoglandular, and typhoidal. Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever, chills, generalized aches, and chronic ulcer at the bite site (ulceroglandular). From the primary site, lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes. Further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs. CFR for Type A (ulcero) glandular disease is < 2% if treated promptly (5 to 30% if not treated). In the acute septic form (typhoidal) of the disease, lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent, and the CFR is high (30–60%). Oculoglandular disease is rare. Ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or GI tularemia. In the oropharyngeal form signs are: throat pain, large tonsils, pseudomembrane, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Symptoms in GI tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death. Pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria, or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.
1–9 weeks; relapses up to more than a year.
Taeniosis: detection of eggs in stool by microscopy; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs; serology; Neurocysticercosis: histology; CT or MRI scan brain; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis.

Repeated re-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A, B, Ba, and C, an obligate intracellular bacterium. The genital serovars D to K can infect the conjunctiva, but generally do not lead to blindness as they cause self-limited infections that typically do not recur.
Depends on infecting dose. Larvae reach adult fluke stage in less than one month.
Standard anti-mosquito precautions. There is no vaccine available.
ICD-9 025; ICD-10 A24.1-A24.4
Probably bird–mosquito–bird. Mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic reservoir birds. This is followed by an extrinsic cycle of a few days in the mosquito, with subsequent transmission to birds or humans by bite. Humans are a dead-end host. There is evidence for vertical (transovarial) transmission in mosquitoes.
The limits of P. falciparum malaria is determined by the presence of vector species and control measures within a certain region. P. falciparum malaria causes approximately 500 million cases each year and around one million deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007 almost 60% of the 2.4 billion people at risk of malaria were living in areas with a stable risk of P. falciparum. High endemicity was most common and widespread in the African region. In the Americas, those at risk were all in the low endemicity class. In Asia 88% are in the low endemicity class, 11% in the intermediate class, and 1% in the high endemicity class. Recent progress is being made by the Global Malaria Action Plan to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality world wide and have a vision for malaria elimination. Ranking countries on the possibility of elimination shows that it is most feasible in the Americas and several countries in Asia and the west Pacific. It is least feasible in Africa, where much of west and central Africa need more than 90% reduction in transmission.
Marine mammals (definitive host), marine invertebrates (intermediate host), and fish (intermediate host). Fish are frequently infected: tuna, cod, mackerel, herring, red snapper, pike, sardines, salmon. A. simplex and A. physeteris are parasites of whales, seals, walruses, sea lions, and related mammals. P. decipiens is found in Pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walruses). Contracaecum spp. are parasites of sea eels and whiting, and have been associated with human anisakiasis.
By bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly.
An estimated 7.6 million people are infected with T. cruzi and 75 million are at risk in Mexico, Central and South America, determined by the range of the vector. Originally American trypanosomiasis was a disease of agricultural workers (mainly adult men) living in rural areas in poor housing conditions. In urban areas transmission is mainly via blood transfusion, and occasionally via ingestion of contaminated sugarcane juice or palm fruit juice. Control programs between 1990 and 2006 resulted in the estimated annual number of deaths falling from more than 45,000 to 12,500, and the incidence of new cases from an estimated 700,000 to 41,200. Chronic cases are diagnosed in non-endemic countries in immigrants. In the USA 300,000 immigrants have Chagas disease, and an estimated 30,000 cases of Chagas cardiomyopathy annually.
Enterotoxin-producing Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 Bengal. Serogroup 01 has two biotypes, classical and El Tor, each with three serotypes: Inaba, Ogawa, and the rarer Hikojima.
1 to 3 days.
Anti-mosquito precautions.
3 days to a few weeks for T. b. rhodesiense, several months to years for T. b. gambiense.
Culiseta melanura: bird to bird; Aedes or Coquillettidia spp.: from bird to other vertebrates (including horses and humans). Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds, and the extrinsic cycle in mosquitoes lasts 2–3 days. Horses and humans are dead-end hosts because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
Fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, and signs of dehydration in severe cases (mainly in young children). In adults the disease is often subclinical. Symptoms last for about one week.
Fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. Occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. The virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.
5–21 days; usually 7–14 days.
Mosquitoes, primarily Aedes and Ochlerotatus spp., secondarily Anopheles spp. Ae. triseriatus (eastern treehole mosquito) is the most important vector of LACV in the USA. LACV is abundant in forests with oak trees (basal holes are important breeding sites) and hickory hardwoods drained by rapid streams. Different species of cold-tolerant mosquitoes serve as vectors for JCV and SSHV.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium, with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90% if the infections in the developed world.
Epidemic hepatitis, infectious hepatitis, infectious jaundice, catarrhal jaundice.
Avoid areas with mites; mite bite prevention by impregnating clothes with miticides; mite elimination in highrisk areas; no effective vaccine is available.
Use of safe water by filtering or boiling or disinfection with temephos (insecticide). Avoid wading in contaminated water, especially people with an apparent worm. There is no vaccine, but tetanus toxoid may be given to prevent tetanus. The Global Guinea Worm Eradication Programme is led by the Carter Center, CDC, WHO, UN Children’s Fund and the individual efforts of endemic nations.
Charbon, malignant pustule, malignant edema, woolsorter disease, tanner disease.
Contact with infected animal tissue. Cutaneous anthrax: direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides, hair, wool, or animal hide products. Gastro-intestinal (GI) anthrax: Contact with infected animal tissue. Cutaneous anthrax: direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides, hair, wool, or animal hide products.
For LBRF, Borrelia recurrentis, a Gram-negative spirochete. For TBRF, at least 15 Borrelia species, each specific to a particular species of tick vector. Since the 1980s, the number of new Borrelia species associated with relapsing fever has increased, in part due to improved diagnostics.
Mosquitoes. The main vector of enzootic VEEV is the Culex (Melanoconion) spp. (Spissipes group). During VEEV outbreaks, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions. Epizootic/epidemic subtypes of VEEV are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera.
Influenza A subtype H5N1, a RNA virus, family Orthomyxoviridae. Avian influenza H5N1 occurs in two forms, a virulent form known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) and a milder form known as ‘low pathogenic’ (LPAI H5N1). H5N1 viruses have diverged into geographically distinct strains (genetic clades).
Tree-hole-breeding forest mosquitoes: Aedes spp. in Africa, and Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. in South America. Transovarian transmission occurs in the mosquito and may be the way the virus survives in the years between cycles. The urban vector on both continents is Aedes aegypti.
Through breaks in skin, ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated dust. There are rare reports of transmission from human or animal cases to humans. Laboratory workers have been infected by aerosols.
Filariasis
Bartonellosis due to B. bacilliformis was originally restricted to high, dry mountain valleys from 600 to 3,200 meters in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Since 1997 it has expanded geographically to the Utcubamba river valley, Cusco, La Libertad and the low-lying hills below 600 meters in coastal Ecuador. The cause for this expansion is unknown. The disease incidence is increasing in Peru, particularly in children. In endemic areas attack rates of 12.7/100 person-years are found, with highest rates in children under 5. There is a decreasing incidence with increasing age due to acquired immunity. For each year of age, the risk of infection diminishes by 4%. Most cases cluster, with 70% occurring in only 18% of households in the community where the outbreak happens.
Hantaviral Disease, New World
The major endemic area is China, with an estimated 20 million people infected, followed by India, Laos, and Myanmar. In the Americas, Ecuador has an estimated 1.5 million cases, but up to 2010 only 9 autochthonous cases of paragonimiasis have been reported from North America (excluding 2 outbreaks in 2006 in California from eating raw freshwater crab imported from Japan). In 1992, the Chinese mitten crab from Korean and Chinese waters positive with Paragonimus eggs was found in western US waters.
Serology (IgM ELISA, Western blot, strip immunoblot, IFA); RT-PCR of biopsy material.
ICD-9 128.8; ICD-10 B83.2
Vector control; personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places); use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars and dog vaccination; there is no vaccine for human use.
ICD-9 125.3; ICD-B73
Echinococcosis, Echinococcus multilocularis
Microscopy for eggs in stool smear (Kato–Katz technique) is often inconclusive due to the similarity to eggs of other trematodes. Intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but not specific. Immunodiagnosis is regarded supportive but not confirmatory. Radiology to demonstrate bile duct pathology. PCR test for O. viverrini is available.
Pertussis immunization has been successful in reducing the burden of pertussis disease and deaths, with around 150,000 cases reported in 2008 compared to almost 2 million cases in 1980. However, these figures must be interpreted with great caution since reporting is mostly based on clinical diagnosis, whichis not easyin neonates, older children, and adults. The WHO estimated that nearly 18 million cases and 254,000 deaths occurred in 2004, of which 90% were in developing countries. Although pertussis disease has clearly been reduced by immunization, it is not clear to what extent immunization has reduced circulation of B. pertussis. The continued risk of pertussis in unimmunized infants and the persistence of epidemic cycles indicate that B. pertussis transmission continues despite vaccination programs. Several developed countries with high coverage in children have experienced outbreaks of pertussis in adolescents and adults. Immunity following natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not permanent, therefore high coverage with pertussis vaccines in children has shifted susceptibility and peak incidence to adolescents and young adults; these age groups are then transmitting infection to young infants. Since pertussis in adults usually manifests as only a prolonged cough it is difficult to identify cases and protect infants.
Oroya fever: penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are all effective, with ampicillin for secondary infections, but the case may still evolve to verruga peruana, which is treatable with streptomycin or rifampicin. Severe cases: ceftriaxone iv is used and blood transfusion in case of severe anemia. Verruga peruana: rifampicin or streptomycin. B. bacilliformis is intrinsically resistant to quinolones.
Rickettsioses, Tick-borne, Old World
ICD-9 121.1; ICD-10 B66.1
None.
Immunization with diphtheria toxoid, usually formulated in a multivalent vaccine (see DTP3 map). Recommended schedule is a primary course of three doses in the first 4 months of life and one or two boosters between 18 months and 5 years. Treatment of cases and carriers with antibiotics to eradicate the organism and prevent further transmission.
Ecological characteristics of the ticks influence the epidemiology of tick-borne rickettsioses. In 1910, the first case of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) R. conorii was considered to be the only agent of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses in Europe and Africa. Similarly, R. sibirica was thought to be the only agent in Russia and China and R. australis in Australia. The reason for this was that diagnosis was made by serologic testing, which cross-reacts with other rickettsial species. Due to improved diagnostics, particularly molecular, the understanding of rickettsioses has increased, and new agents are being found regularly. Multiple distinct tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses are recognized. The name of the agent informs us where the agent was initially found, but most agents have a more widespread distribution.
Brucellosis
SARS is thought to have emerged in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 and within 6 months cases were detected in 26 countries, with local transmission occurring in 6. In total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and, remarkably, much of the global transmission of SARS can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in Hong Kong. ‘Super spreading’ events (where one person infects an unusually large number of people), such as occurred at the Hong Kong Hotel, appear to be an important feature of SARS epidemiology. The precise circumstances and timing of the interspecies transfer of SARS-CoV remains unknown. Many of the early cases in Guangdong had epidemiological links to the wild animal trade but later the transmission of SARS was exclusively person-to-person with a large nosocomial element. Laboratory-accident associated cases in late 2003 and April 2004, and a cluster linked to the wild animal trade in January 2004, highlight the potential for the re-emergence of SARS.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, (formerly Pseudomonas pseudomallei), an aerobic, motile Gram-negative bacillus of the beta-proteobacteria group. It is oxidase positive, resistant to a wide range of antibiotics including gentamicin, polymyxin, and the second-generation cephalosporins. A similar disease of equines called glanders, now rare (extinct in the Americas), is caused by the related bacterium B. mallei. Both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are listed as potential biological warfare agents.
It is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, such as Papua New Guinea, South Africa, parts of India and Indonesia, and among the aborigines of Australia. Some cases have been reported in the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean. The disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors. In some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in HIV patients. In the USA, it is more common in African-Americans, of people in lower socioeconomic status, and those with poor hygiene. It has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of K. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus, or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material. There is no gender difference in incidence; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. There are no reports of congenital infections, but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation. Donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection.
Bilharziasis, Katayama fever or syndrome, urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis.
Intravenous, intramuscular, and intralesional application of pentavalent antimonials; also miltefosine is being tested for its efficacy. Topical treatment options are: paramomycin, ketoconazole, and thermotherapy.
This is unknown at present. M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. In Australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
Malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the Thai–Cambodian border region. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); the choice of ACTs is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. Severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an ACT or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. The Montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
Botulinum toxin, produced by the anerobic sporeforming bacterium Clostridium botulinum types A, B, E and rarely F. Type E and F neurotoxins have been recovered from infants with botulism due to C. butyricum and C. barati. C. botulinum is considered a biological warfare agent.
None.
Humans; the parasite has also been detected in non-human primates (cynomolgus monkeys, macaques). E. moshkovskii can be found in varying wet environments: clean river sediments, sewage, and brackish coastal pools.
Hantaviral Disease, Old World
ICD-121.2; ICD-10 B66.4

Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
Female mosquito of the genus Anopheles; mainly bites between dusk and dawn (see Anopheles map).
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.1
Sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and can progress with signs of myalgia, photophobia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and congestion of conjunctivae. After 3–4 days there can be a remission phase leading to either recovery or more severe disease with hemorrhagic signs (epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, melena) and hepatorenal syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. CFR in severe cases is 15 to 50%.
Barmah Forest & Ross River Virus Disease
Enteric by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products (soft cheese, yoghurt) from infected animals; direct inoculation of mucosa or skin with infected animal tissue (usually occupational in farmers or butchers); inhalation in housing of infected animals. Brucellosis is an occupational disease in shepherds, abattoir workers, veterinarians, dairy industry workers, and microbiology laboratory staff. No person-to-person transmission apart from isolated case reports of sexual transmission.
IgM ELISA; IgG cross-reacts with other alphaviruses. Confirmation needed by neutralization test, virus isolation, or a significant rise in specific antibody between acute and convalescent serum samples; RT-PCR.
Dipstick test, dark-field or phase microscopy on fecal or rectal swab smear; bacterial culture.
ICD-9 121.4; ICD-10 B66.5
Hookworm morbidity is higher in patients infected with large numbers of adult parasites. Attachment of the hookworm to the intestinal mucosa results in loss of blood, eventually resulting in anemia and malnutrition in chronic cases. Chronic hookworm infection can impair cognitive and growth development in children.
Pasteurization. Persons at high risk of infection should avoid high-risk foods (smoked fish, raw meat sausage, soft cheeses) and sufficiently heat foods (e.g. left-overs), chemoprophylaxis can be given to susceptible persons at risk after exposure to contaminated food. The organism can replicate at refrigerator temperatures.
Vaccination with vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides. Both conjugated and non-jugated vaccines are available. Conjugated vaccines targeting either 7, 9, 10, or 13 capsule types are recommended for children under 5 years of age and risk groups. The 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine can only be used in individuals older than 2 years and at high risk of disease. National surveillance of pneumococcal disease and infecting serotypes is required to detect vaccine escapees, requiring vaccine modification. Individuals are not protected against pneumococcal capsule types not in the vaccine. Through the GAVI Alliance, low-income countries can access pneumococcal vaccines with a small contribution. Rwanda was the first GAVI-eligible country that introduced the vaccine in 2009.
The blood-feeding nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). A. ceylanicum has a limited distribution. The adult nematodes are up to 10mm long.
Typical skin ulcer, eschar, may develop at the site of the mite’s bite. Several days later fever, headache, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy may develop. Dry cough with signs of pneumonitis, jaundice, and meningoencepahlitis may occur. Scrub typhus severity and clinical presentation is probably strain dependent.
Amebiasis, Entamoeba histolytica
By mosquito bite.
ICD-9 078.7; ICD-10 A96
Occupational hygiene by the use of protective clothing and avoiding contaminated surface waters (difficult in case of flooding in developing countries). Environmental control measures, like rodent and flood control, are difficult to implement. Chemoprophylaxis for adventure travelers, military personnel who visit endemic areas, and after an accidental lab exposure.
ICD-9 065.0; ICD-10 A98.0
Granuloma inguinale, granuloma venereum.
Botulism
The parasite isingested by a tsetse fly during feeding on an infected host, and enters the salivary glands after 12–30 days, and can be transmitted to new susceptible hosts during the life of the fly (3 months). There is no vertical transmission in the fly.
3–32 days, mean 7–10 days for EM. Since EM can remain absent, the interval between the tick bite and disease can be much longer.
Microscopy: in Giemsa-stained blood smears Schüfnner’s dots are seen; rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); PCR.
Food-borne botulism: intensive supportive care and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv. Wound botulism: wound debridement, antibiotics (penicillin) and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv. Equine botulinum antitoxin can prevent progression of illness and shorten symptoms in food-borne and wound botulism if administered early. Avoid aminoglycoside antibiotics as these may potentiate the toxin and result in a complete neuromuscular blockade and resultant paralysis.
Babesiosis
ICD-9 062.5; ICD-10 A83.5
Approximately 1 million people are infected with Schistosoma spp. in Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, and the Philippines. Schistosomiasis has been eliminated from Japan and the burden has been greatly reduced in China through extensive control efforts. Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease, that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. Higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to large irrigation projects or dams. S. japonicum is found in China, Philippines, and Indonesia. In Indonesia, schistosomiasis is confined to two endemic areas in Central Sulawesi. S. mekongi is found in the Mekong River area of Cambodia and Laos, and has also been detected in Thailand. S. malayensis has only been reported from Malaysia and is a rare cause of human disease.
Sudden onset of fever lasting 2–7 days, sometimes biphasic, severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and a maculopapular rash (not easily seen on dark skin). Most cases recover. Minor occurrence of petechiae, epistaxis, or gingival bleeding may be seen. Serious hemorrhagic manifestations, like a severe drop in blood platelets, indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), that can progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity, but little cross-immunity to other serotypes. Cross-immunity may exacerbate, rather than diminish, disease severity when infected with a new serotype; DHF leading to DSS can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype, but DHF/DSS has also been reported in primary infections. CFR for DHF is up to 20%, for untreated DSS up to 50%, and 1–2% if correctly treated.
Serology (IFA,ELISA)or RT-PCR on bloodor CSF. Serology may cross-react with otherflaviviruses andlead to false-positives. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNT) and virus isolation are only done in specialized laboratories.
Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ‘daily lives,’ mainly during heavy rainfall. Most foci are found in Latin America and the Caribbean, India, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and eastern Europe. The agent favors warm, humid environments. The prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present, local environmental conditions, local occupation, and agricultural practices. Protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs, like mining, sewermaintenance, farming, veterinary work, and the military. In the tropics, occupational exposures (rice and sugar cane farming, fishing) and other agricultural activities remain an important risk. Leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums, especially during rainy seasons. Also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks.
Endemic syphilis (bejel, nonvenereal) syphilis, pinta (carate), yaws (frambesia), nonvenereal treponematosis.
HEV is more prevalent in areas with hot climates and poor sanitation. Outbreaks are more common during heavy rainfall and flooding, which leads to fecal contamination of the drinking water. Food-borne outbreaks also occur, especially with contaminated shellfish. HEV genotypes have their own geographic distribution. HEV-1 is common in high endemic areas of Asia and Africa. HEV-2 can be found in Mexico andWest Africa. HEV-3 has been found in rare cases in the USA and several developed countries in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Argentina. HEV-4 causes sporadic human cases in Southeast Asia and Japan. HEV-3 and HEV-4 are also reported in pigs on all continents, causing sporadic disease in humans.
Wear clothes that cover extremities; cover skin lesions; insect repellent; cover water supply.
None.
Therapy is aimed at neutralizing the potent exotoxin, eradicating the organism, and providing supportive care. Immediate treatment with diphtheria antitoxin and iv antibiotics (penicillin or macrolide).
Endoscopic identification of larvae. Eggs and larvae are not found in the feces. Specific antibody tests are available for anisakis-associated hypersensitivity.
Fever, headache, vomiting, sometimes progressing to acute CNS and respiratory involvement, with recurrent seizures in 25% of CNS cases. INKV is associated with severe illness and chronic neurologic disease in Russia.
Mycetoma
The precise mechanism is unclear: probably by aerosol spread of nasal secretions from a case to respiratory mucosa of close contacts. M. leprae cannot cross intact skin. The relative risk for leprosy disease in household contacts is 8 to 10 for multibacillary (lepromatous) leprosy and 2 to 4 for paucibacillary (tuberculoid) leprosy.
Bordetella pertussis a Gram-negative, fastidious bacterium (Bordetella parapertussis causes a milder illness called parapertussis).
Rat bite fever is a rare and underreported disease with a worldwide distribution. S. minus infection is reported less frequently than S. moniliformis and occurs mainly in Asia, particularly Japan. World wide, millions of people are bitten by animals each year and rats are responsible for about 1% of these bites. It is estimated that 2% of rat bites lead to an infection (all causes). It is unknown what the proportion of rat bite fever is of these infections. The relation between humans and animals is changing which may alter the epidemiology of rat bite fever. Rats have become a pet in several countries, while it used to be considered a pest. Children handling pet rats may be a special risk group. More than half of the reported cases of rat bite fever occur in children.
Not completely understood: moist environments close to waterways, in forest or under flooring, also sandy and acidic soil and rotten vegetation. Bird excreta have also been implicated as a potential reservoir. Dogs are more commonly infected than humans but do not transmit disease.
ICD-9 078.8; ICD-10 B33.8
Search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing. Use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing. There is no effective vaccine.
ICD-9 032; ICD-10 A36
Tacaribe complex viruses are spherical or pleomorphic, enveloped arenaviruses containing two single-stranded RNA molecules, with four distinct lineages (A, B, C, and a recombinant RecA). Out of more than 20 known arenaviruses, only the following have been associated with human disease: Chapare, Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Whitewater Arroyo viruses. All South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, except Whitewater Arroyo virus, are classified as high-priority bioterrorism pathogens. Other Tacaribe complex arenaviruses are capable of infecting humans and possibly cause disease.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Anti-mosquito precautions.
Usually 2–5 days (range 1–10 days).
Flies can contaminate foods.
Contamination of a break in the skin by bacilli in the environment, or by the bite of an infected aquatic insect or mosquito. Person-to-person transmission is rare.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis, caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain. Katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals (e.g. travelers) and relatively rare among local residents with exposure since childhood. S. mansoni causes intestinal schistosomiasis with: diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, hepatosplenomegaly. S. haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis with dysuria, hematuria, hemospermia, and dyspareunia. S. intercalatumand S. guineensis: granulomas, rectal polyps and ulcers. Chronic infection may lead toliverfibrosis,hepatosplenomegaly, and portal hypertension (S. mansoni), obstructive uropathy, bacterial infection,infertility, and bladder cancer (S. haematobium); rectitis, salpingitis, infertility and abortion (S. intercalatum, S. guineensis); anemia and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children. Rarely, CNS disease may follow S. haematobium and S. guineensis infection.
Humans.
3–10 days for streptobacillosis, 1–3 weeks for spirillosis.
Hydrophobia, furious rabies, paralytic (dumb) rabies, classic rabies, non-classic rabies
LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969. It is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic Lassa fever cases in West Africa each year, with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000. Lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions: the Mano River region (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia) in the West, and Nigeria in the East. In the dry season, the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses, and in the rainy season, the rat forages in the surrounding fields. Villages with Lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah, where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm. LFV can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season. However, in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses.
Leishmaniasis, Visceral
Immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
Cancrum oris, gangrenous stomatitis
High fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, maculopapular rash beginning on the face, spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet. Characteristic small white spots (Koplik spots) on the buccal mucosa. Complications may consist of otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheal bronchitis (croup), blindness, severe skin infections, severe diarrhea and encephalitis, sometimes fatal. Complications are more common and more severe in people with malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and chronic diseases. Very rarely, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may appear years later.
Streptomycin, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides are standard; alternatives are gentamicin and fluoroquinolones. Chloramphenicol in cases of plague meningitis. Treatment should be started within 18 hours of onset. Buboes may need to be drained.
Penicillin for both forms of rat bite fever. Penicillin resistance in S. moniliformis is rare. Tetracycline in penicillinallergic patients.
Detection of Donovan bodies in cytodiagnostic or histopathologic examination (may be absent when pretreated with antibiotics); histology is similar to that of rhinoscleroma; PCR.
ICD-9 078.8; ICD-10 A96.2
Usually asymptomatic or mild. Diarrhea alternating with constipation, vomiting and anorexia, edema of the face, abdominal wall and legs, ascites. Heavy worm loads may cause bowel obstruction. Eosinophilia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and secondary anemia may occur.
Humans.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Mycobacterium ulcerans, an acid-fast, slow-growing bacillus. There are at least four geographically distinct strains: African, American, Asian, and Australian. They all produce mycolactone, which destroys tissue and suppresses the immune system. Variations in the structure of mycolactone may correlate with disease severity in different regions.
Hygiene, access to clean water and sanitation. An oral cholera vaccine is available which is safe and provides sustained protection of > 50% that lasts for 2 years in endemic populations. The vaccine does not protect against infections with O139 strains. Chemoprophylaxis for contacts may consist of tetracycline or doxycycline. Breast-feeding protects infants. Quarantine is ineffective. Infection results in limited protection against homologous strains, but there is no cross-protection. Cholera must be reported to national health authorities as small local outbreaks may become large epidemics.
Depends on infecting dose. For acute disease, usually 3 to 4 weeks. For chronic disease, up to several years.
The principle vector is the human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis), which lives in clothes. B. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas.
By inhalation of aerosols from dried rodent excreta. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported.
Environment (soil) to human. Fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs.
Blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph Ajellomyces dermatitidis), a dimorphic fungus: grows as a pathogenic yeast at body temperature and as a mold in the environment.
Systemic treatment to prevent dissemination with pentavalent antimonials. Depending on the infecting Leishmania species, alternative systemic treatment can be administered with: amphotericin B, pentamidine, or miltefosine. Topical treatment options are: paramomycin, ketoconazole, and thermotherapy.
Serology: IgM capture ELISA on serum or CSF; antibodies can be detected in CSF after 4 days of disease onset, and in serum after 7 days. Virus isolation or viral RNA detection by RT-PCR are insensitive.
Serologic tests to assess active infection: HBsAg, HBeAg; HBV DNA can be detected in blood by PCR; quantitative PCR to monitor treatment.
Mainly skin contact with fecally contaminated soil, but oral transmission cannot be excluded.
1–12 days, usually 3–7.
Chronic, painless skin nodule that progresses to a severe,deforming ulcer. One-third of early nodules heal spontaneously. Most nodules appear on limbs, but also face and breast; skin lesions may also appear as plaques or indurated edematous lesions; osteomyelitis. Typical characteristic is the presence of deeply undermined ulcers. Sequelae include contracture, deformity, and permanent disability.
Summer diarrhea, acute diarrhea.
Fibrous subcutaneous nodules in the head and shoulders (Americas), pelvic girdle and legs (Africa), a pruritic rash, disfiguring skin lesions (chronic papular and lichenified onchodermatitis), skin depigmentation (leopard skin), edema and skin atrophy, inflammatory process in the cornea leading to irreversible blindness, growth arrest, and epilepsy. The proportion of depigmentation and blindness is most common in older ( > 40 years) age groups. The disease may lead to excess mortality.
Cholera
Valley fever, San Joaquin fever, Desert fever, Desert rheumatism, California disease.
Early stage disease: suramin for T. b. rhodesiense, pentamidine forT. b. gambiense; Late stage disease: melarsoprol for both forms; eflornithine with or without nifurtimox for gambiense. These drugs can cause SAEs.
Sanitation. Avoid eating uncooked water plants in endemic areas. Do not fertilize water plants for consumption with human or pig feces. Abandon practice of feeding water plants to pigs. Health education. The eggs can resist low temperatures and can be maintained at 4 C for 3 to 4 months; they are killed at 50 C in 4 hours. Water can be chemically treated to kill the flukes.
Mosquito-host-mosquito. The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host. Depending on ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days.
Sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, and headache, followed by pharyngitis, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. Severe cases have internal and external hemorrhages, CNS involvement and multi-organ failure leading to terminal shock. The case fatality rate (CFR) varies, depending on location, virus involved, and clinical care: 0% for RESTV and TAFV, 34% for BDBV; 78% for EBOV, 53% for SUDV, 82% for MARV. Recovery may be prolonged and accompanied by long term sequelae, particularly hearing loss. Filoviruses can persist for months and disease may recur.
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.
Uncomplicated malaria: acute febrile illness with headache, chills, sweats, nausea, and vomiting; hepatosplenomegaly. Findings of severe malaria can be: cerebral malaria (confusion, seizures, impaired consciousness to coma), hemolysis, severe anemia, hypotension, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and death. Often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria ( > 5% infected erythrocytes).
Rat–mollusc–rat; humans are incidental dead-end hosts. Larvae are excreted with rat feces, ingested by vectormolluscs, in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days. When ingested by a rat, the larvae enter the brain, mature into adults, and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs. There, female worms lay eggs (about 15,000 per day) that hatch into larvae, which in 6–8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx, are swallowed and excreted. When ingested by a human, the third stage larvae also migrate to the CNS, but the worm does not mature.
ICD-9 120; ICD-10 B65
Infections are often mild, with more severe neurologic disease in 4–14% of the cases that may progress to death. VEEV infection often presents like an influenza-like illness. Severe encephalitis is less common in adults as compared to children. Absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and Mayaro fevers. About 30% of survivors have neurological sequelae. CFR for VEE is <1%. VEEV infection may cause stillbirths.
Screening blood and blood products before use, bottle-feeding (20% of breast-fed infants of infected mothers become infected), using condoms. Counseling and education of IVDUs to implement harm reduction practices.
ICD-9 010-018; ICD-10 A15–A19
Principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
Application of residual insecticides or insecticidal paint inside dwellings, use ofinsecticide-treated bed nets, screening of blood and organ donors from infected areas. Application of these methods has eradicated intradomiciliary transmission from Uruguay (1997), Chile (1999), Guatemala (2005), Brazil (2006), the eastern region of Paraguay, andfive of the endemic provinces of Argentina. Honduras and Nicaragua are awaiting certification of eradication. Only the food-borne risk remains in those areas.
Supportive and palliative as rabies is almost invariably fatal. Heavy sedation with supportive management needs further study (Milwaukee protocol). Vaccination after onset of rabies confers no benefit.
Isolation of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs.
Human infection is associated with cold waters in the northern hemisphere. A 2005 estimate stated that 20 million people were infected world wide. It is common in communities, as in Japan, that have a habit of eating raw or undercooked fish. Risky fish dishes are sushi, sashimi, South American ceviche, fish carpaccio, salmon tartare, and salted or marinated fillets in Scandinavia or Baltic region. Historically, Finland and Alaska had a high disease prevalence, but this has decreased due to preventive measures. Women seem more at risk, probably due to being involved in meal preparation. The disease incidence is increasing in some countries such as Russia, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. Cases are also reported from regions where diphyllobothriasis was expected to have been eliminated, such as Alpine lakes in Switzerland, northern Italy, and eastern France. It is not clear whether the cases reported in Hawaii and Brazil are autochthonous or from imported fish. D. nihonkaiense, present in Japan and far eastern Russia, has been reported from a patient who ate raw Pacific sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from British Columbia, Canada. D. pacificum (formerly D. arctocephalinum) is increasingly reported as a human parasite along the coast of South America. Infected fish can be transported to any part of the world for consumption.
ICD-9 070.1; ICD-10 B15.
Microscopy to detect microfilariae in finger-prick blood smears; immunochromatic test cards; ultrasound to locate ‘nests.’
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 R50.9 (Barmah Forest) and B33.1 (Ross River)
Direct examination of blood smear (low sensitivity), PCR, serology (indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination). Serology can give false positive results. Culture takes weeks.
Usually 14–21 days, up to several months.
S. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children and adults. Risk factors for severe disease are: older age ( > 65 years), diabetes, chronic disease (heart, lung, kidney, liver), alcoholism, cancer, HIV, non-functioning or absent spleen, and sickle cell disease. A global burden of disease study estimated that in 2000 about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occurred world wide, leading to about 826,000 deaths in children <5 years. The most common presentation of severe disease is pneumonia. The majority of deaths (95%) occurred in Africa and Asia. Since 2000 the pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced, mostly in developed countries,while developing countries need themmost. In 2008, 24 high-income and two middle-income countries had pneumococcal vaccination in their program, accounting for less than 0.2% of childhood pneumococcal deaths in 2000. Many deaths in low-income countries are due to poor healthcare infrastructure and inadequate treatment options. Penicillin and chloramphenicol are still widely used to treat meningitis despite high resistance levels against these agents in some areas. Vaccination and access to proper treatment are needed in Africa and Asia. Interventions should be targeted on countries with large populations and moderate incidence, and countries with high incidence and mortality.
Plasmodium knowlesi, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. P. knowlesi is an Old World simian malaria parasite.
By mosquito bite. Transmission from mother to neonate can occur in the intrapartum period; blood-borne transmission is possible.
Noma is an opportunistic infection with endogenous buccal flora.
ICD-9 036.0; ICD-10 A39.0
Single im injection with benzathine penicillin G.
By contact with the excretions, or materials contaminated with the excretions, of an infected rodent, such as ingestion of contaminated food or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement. Infection can also occur by inhalation of minute particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). Person-to-person transmission is rare and known only for Machupo virus.
Recovery of bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid, blood or fluid from arthritic joints; culture; PCR. Streptococcus suis is often misidentified as another streptococcus species and therefore underdiagnosed.
Probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in Panama and French Guiana, also in the USA from a north-bound migratory bird. Antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
Doxycycline; erythromycin for pregnant women; alternatives are ceftriaxone, norfloxacin and trovofloxacin; in cases of no response: gentamicin; surgery in advanced cases.
Gradual onset of malaise, headache, and retro-orbital pain, conjunctivitis, fever, and sweats, followed by prostration. Petechiae on the soft palate are frequent, on the body with ecchymoses less frequent. In severe cases: epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematuria, and gingival hemorrhage. Enceplalopathy, intention tremors, depressed deep tendon reflexes, bradycardia, and hypotension with shock are common. Infection during pregnancy can result in abortion. Convalescence may be prolonged. CFR due to these viruses, even after intensive hospital treatment, can be as high as 33%.
Direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets.
VEEV was isolated for the first time in 1938 from a diseased horse in Venezuela. The VEEV distribution is limited to the Americas, and predominantly in Central and South America. In 1995, a large outbreak with approximately 100,000 human cases, of which 300 were fatal, happened in Colombia and Venezuela. The Guajira peninsula (region in northern Colombia and northwest Venezuela) has the highest disease burden, probably due to a large donkey population that serves as an amplifying host. In 2005, human VEE cases were detected for the first time in Bolivia, cause by a new Bolivia–Peru ID genotype. Typical VEEV enzootic habitats are lowland forests and swamps in (sub)tropical areas of the Americas, from northern Argentina up to southern USA (Florida and Colorado). Enzootic subtype distribution generally does not overlap, except in the Amazon regions.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control; disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas; formalin-inactivated HTNV vaccines are used in Russia, China and Korea.
Depends on portal of entry. The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. GI anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), GI anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
Weeks to months; median 45 days.
Leishmania species, protozoa, members of the Trypanosomatidae family, order Kinetoplastida. Based on development characteristics in the sandfly, Leishmania species are classified into the subgenera Viannia and Leishmania, within which there are various species complexes. Leishmania species causing (muco)cutaneous disease in the Americas are: L. (Viannia) braziliensis (espundia), L. (Viannia) colombiensis, L. (Leishmania) mexicana (chiclero ulcer), L. (Leishmania) pifanoi, L. (Viannia) liansoni, L. (Leishmania) garnhami, L. (Leishmania) amazonensis, L. (Viannia) panamensis, L. (Viannia) guyanensis (forest yaws), and L. (Viannia) peruviana (Uta). L. infantum/ chagasi can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. L. chagasi is considered to be the same species as L. infantum, and will be referred to as L. infantum/chagasi.
Two or more doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are necessary for protection. Global coverage with three doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are shown elsewhere (see DTP3 map). Infants under the age of 3–5 months are, depending on the vaccination schedule, too young to have received two doses and are also vulnerable to complications of pertussis. This group therefore suffers the greatest burden of pertussis mortality. Post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic may be recommended for contacts in households where there is a susceptible member (e.g. an infant).
Taeniosis is T. solium infection of the small intestine and varies from asymptomatic (the most frequent) to weight loss, anorexia and abdominal pain. Cysticercosis is a tissue infection with T. solium larvae with findings depending on where cysticerci develop (subcutaneous, eye, heart, CNS). Its localization in the CNS, causing neurocysticercosis, is the most severe form of the disease: seizures, headache, focal neurologic signs, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus may develop. The CFR is low.
Tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas, and in warm and wet regions. In the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, mostly in newborn infants. The current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults. In countries with good vaccine coverage in children, adult cases may still be common, as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus. The DTP3 Vaccination Coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood. The elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79% (153/193) of WHO Member States. However, since C. tetani will always remain present in nature, tetanus will always remain a threat, and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely.
Self-limiting disease. Sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. Relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. Patients eventually recover completely.
Humans. Rotaviruses in animals are distinct from those causing disease in humans.
Immunocompromised, asplenic, and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. The number of cases diagnosed in the USA has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population, hosts of the adult vector ticks. Nearly all patients with Babesia divergens infection in Europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. The B. divergens-like parasite in the USA has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits, and is not infectious for cattle; it has been found in only 3 patients. All 3 patients with B. venatorum (EU1) infection had also been splenectomized. Cape Verdean, Egyptian, and Asian cases lie outside the range of Ixodes ricinus; B. duncani and B. divergens-like cases in west coast states of USA lie outside the range of I. scapularis. Possible vectors for these cases are I. dentatus in the central USA, and I. pacificus on the west coast. Infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Serology or RT-PCR on blood or CSF; virus isolation.
Inhalation of arthroconidia (reproductive spores) from the environment or dusty fomites. Sometimes through direct inoculation or transplantation. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare.
Wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. Hyraxes for L. aethiopica.
Sindbis virus (SINV), a single-stranded, positive sense, enveloped RNA alphavirus, with 5 genotypes: SIN I (European/African), SIN II and III (Asian/Australian), SIN IV (Azerbaijan/China), and SIN V (New Zealand). The first Sindbis virus isolated was cultured in 1952 from a mosquito near Sindbis village in the Nile Delta (Egypt). Almost 10 years later the first human case was detected in Uganda in 1961 and in Europe in 1971.
Serology; there is no serological test that can distinguish between T. pallidum and the non-venereal T. pallidum subspecies. Definitively diagnosis by PCR and sequencing.
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a chronic progressive systemic mycosis. There are two disease forms: (1) an acute/subacute form in children that mainly involves the reticulo-endothelial system, and (2) a chronic or adult form with a long latent period, that mainly affects men and generally is a pulmonary infection. The disease can disseminate to mucous membranes, skin, and lymph nodes. Relapses occur in immune-compromised patients and in those with disseminated disease. CFR can be up to 10%, highest in children with underlying conditions, and lowest in adults.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea, where the first hantavirus (Hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are: Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumula virus (PUUV), and Saaremaa virus (SAAV). Seoul virus (SEOV) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
Bite of infective female sandfly. Rare reports exist of non-vector transmission, including transmission by blood transfusion, sharing of syringes, venereal contact, and possibly transplacentally; potential transmission via organ transplantation.
By mosquito bite.
Personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticide of breeding places). There is no vaccine for human use.
Few hours for gastric anisakiasis, several weeks for intestinal anisakiasis. Immediate for anisakisassociated hypersensitivity after eating (either raw or cooked) food containing the allergen.
Leptospira chronically colonize the proximal renal tubules of many animals and are excreted in the urine into the environment. Animals can shed Leptospira into the environment for prolonged periods without any signs of disease.
ICD-9 062; ICD-10 A83.1
Infective larvae in soil invade the skin; A. duodenale larvae can also infect via oral ingestion.
Direct contact with sick or dead poultry (most common) infected with HPAI, and possibly via inhalation of virus-laden particles or contact of contaminated material with the eyes or respiratory mucosa. Other postulated routes: ingestion of water contaminated with the feces of infected birds, consumption of undercooked products from infected birds. Often, however, the route of exposure is not clear. Limited person-to-person transmission of HPAI H5N1 is possible following prolonged close contact with an infected patient.
By inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodent host, or contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. Nosocomial transmission is regular in resource-constrained settings.
Usually 14–84 days for acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome); chronic schistosomiasis can be asymptomatic for a long period, months to years.
Hares, hedgehogs, wild mice, livestock, ostriches. Since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially, ticks also serve as reservoirs.
By mosquito bite. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Herbivores become infected when they ingest spores during grazing on contaminated soil. When the animal dies, the soil under the carcase is contaminated. Omnivores and carnivores are infected by feeding on infected prey or carcases. Carnivores and humans are incidental hosts.
ICD-9 045; ICD-10 A80
Giant intestinal fluke infection.
ICD-9 070.5; ICD-10 B17.2.
The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. The infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. O. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
About 12 days.
Colorado tick fever is only present in North America (USA and Canada). In the USA, besides the states with human cases shown on the map, the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of D. andersoni. The typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with Ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry, rocky surfaces. Infection is seasonal, coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer. Human cases can be detected from March to September in the Rocky Mountain region, USA. Most human cases are males, aged 20–29 years, probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains.
Tick–vertrebrate–tick with humans as accidental host. Animals preferred for feeding depends on tick species and their life stage.
Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Culex, Mansonia and others. There is transovarian transmission of RVFV in mosquitoes. Dried mosquito eggs can remain viable and infected for years. Originally, the eggs are laid in the damp soil above the water line and hatch when flooded.
Monkeys, possibly rodents.
Virus isolation, RT-PCR, serology. Both viruses are BSL-4 agents.
ICD-9 020; ICD-10 A20
Humans.
Fever and signs of meningitis (headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, intolerance of light, and decreased level of consciousness). Hearing loss, generally permanent, in around 50% of those infected. Arthritis, pneumonia, and fatal toxic shock syndrome are possible complications.
Sudden onset fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, severe abdominal or lower back pain, often with nausea and vomiting, followed by hypotension which may progress to shock, hemorrhages and renal involvement, and death. Convalescence is prolonged. PUUV virus causes less severe disease. The CFR is 5–15% for HFRS; for PUUV and SAAV infection the CFR is 1%; for DOBV the CFR is 9–12%. The differential diagnosis is leptospirosis or rickettsioses.
Humans and a wide variety of domestic and wild mammals, especially dogs, cats, guinea-pigs, rodents, and opossums.
Endemic syphilis and yaws: 2 weeks to 3 months; pinta: 18 weeks.
Ingested E. histolytica non-motile cysts will excyst in the gastrointestinal tract and develop to motile trophozoites that can penetrate the gut mucosa. In the colon, the trophozoites encyst and the cysts are excreted with the feces.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus belonging to the family of Hepadnaviridae. There are 8 genotypes (A to H) with marked differences in disease severity. Genotypes are classified by comparing complete HBV genomes. The map illustrates the distribution of chronic HBV infection. Co-infection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) may occur resulting in severe chronic liver disease. HDV is a defective RNA virus that requires HBV for replication.
Chikungunya means ‘that which bends up’ in Makonde language, to describe the pain.
Hepatitis A
Thought to be acquired primarily through ingestion of infected tissue from cattle with BSE. Iatrogenic transmission has occurred through blood transfusion. To date there have been no known transmissions of vCJD by tissue or organ transplantation from infected people, or through contaminated surgical instruments.
Vaccination of risk groups; eradicating carriage; hygiene; sanitation; access to clean water; pasteurization of dairy products; quality control and hygiene procedures for the food industry; exclude typhoid carriers from food handling.
E. histolytica is distributed world wide, especially in countries with poor sanitation and little access to clean water (see Water and Sanitation maps). It is estimated that E. histolytica is responsible for 40,000 to 100,000 deaths per year. Most prevalence studies in the past did not distinguish between E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar, and therefore little is known of the current disease prevalence of the pathogenic E. histolytica. E. histolytica infection is endemic in Mexico, India, South Africa, some Central and South American countries, and Asian Pacific countries. Community-based studies in urban slums in Bangladesh showed that: 9% of preschool children suffer from amebic diarrhea each year, with 2% requiring a hospital visit. In developed countries, amebiasis is seen in travelers and immigrants from developing countries, and cases may also be found in closed psychiatric institutions. MSM are also a risk group, since they are more exposed.
Mosquito species that breedin rice fields and marshes, principally Culex tritaenorhynchus group; also C. gelidus and C. vishnui.
N. meningitidis is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets.
Sudden onset of fever (which may be biphasic), malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins and marked anorexia; occasionally vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hemorrhage in oropharynx, nose, lungs, uterus, intestines; hematomas, echymosis, and petechiae; hematuria and albuminuria. In Russia, estimates are that only 1 in 6 cases is hemorrhagic. The CFR ranges from 2 to 80% in different countries.
Classically meningococcal meningitis presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. In infants and young children the clinical picture may be non-specific. If the patient also has meningococcal bacteremia, a hemorrhagic skin rash may be seen.
O’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, closely related to chikungunya virus (CHIKV, see Chikungunya Fever map). Strains bear the names Gulu, Igbo-Ora, and SG650 viruses.
In 1988, the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area. To be certified polio-free, three conditions must be met: (1) there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus; (2) disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards; and (3) each country must illustrate the capacity to detect, report, and respond to ‘imported’ polio cases. Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. For this reason, efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination.
Whitmore disease.
In early and limited disease: 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin. For more extensive disease: rifampicin plus streptomycin for 8 weeks; extensive lesions may require reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy. Lesions < 5cm can be excised under local anesthetic.
Haemophilus influenzae Type b
Need to treat both P. vivax blood and liver stage. Uncomplicated P. vivax malaria: Need to treat both P. vivax blood and liver stage.
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host. The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito. After a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
Humans for T. b. gambiense; livestock and wildlife for T. b. rhodesiense. Vector: Tsetse fly (Glossina). The main human vectors belong to the palpalis (riverine flies) and morsitans (forest and savannah flies) complex. The palpalis complex (G. fuscipes, G. palpalis, G. tachinoides) mainly transmit T. b. gambiense and the morsitans complex (G. morsitans, G. pallidipes, G. swynnertoni) mainly transmit T. b. rhodesiense. G. fuscipes and G. tachinoides can transmit both subspecies.
Eggs develop in water in 3–7 weeks, hatch producing miracidia which enter the intermediate snail hosts, in which they develop into cercariae. The cercariae encyst on water plants and develop to metacercariae. When ingested, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, where the flukes attach to the mucosa of the small intestine, mature, and start egg production in 2 to 3 months.
Serology (EIA, recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA)); RT-PCR on plasma; quanititative RT-PCR to monitor treatment; genotyping; liver biopsy for histology to assess disease stage and activity.
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness, clindamycin and quinine for severe disease. Exchange transfusion for life-threatening infection, dialysis in case of renal failure. Chloroquine is ineffective.
The estimated prevalence of strongyloidiasis is between 30 and 100 million infections in 70 countries world wide; however, the accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to poor performance of screening methods. Most cases are found in tropical and subtropical areas (warm, moist). Rarely, it is found in foci in North America and Europe. It is of significance in developed nations as it can cause hyperinfection in immunocompromised patients that have been infected years before in an endemic region. The most important risk factor for hyperinfection is corticosteroid therapy; other risk factors are: hematologic malignancies, malnutrition, alcoholism, HTLV-1 infection, and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplantation). Interestingly, hyperinfection is not commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals in endemic countries.
Standard antitick precautions; avoidance of raw aquatic food from N. sennetsu endemic regions.
Less than 1% of infections result in acute flaccid paralysis, with around 90% of infections being subclinical. In 10% symptoms may include fever, malaise, headache, neck stiffness, pain in the limbs, nausea, and vomiting. Paralysis persists in 0.1–1.0% depending on the virulence of the strain. The flaccid paralysis is usually asymmetric and in one leg. The risk of paralysis is increased by intramuscular injections, immune-compromised state, trauma or surgery (tonsillectomy), and intense physical activity during the incubation period. Also adults are at greater risk of developing paralysis than young children. Aseptic meningitis occurs in around 1% of infections. More severe paralysis with quadriplegia and breathing problems (bulbar polio) may occur.
By bite of the vector.
Person-to-person via inhalation of infectious aerosols from cases with pulmonary TB, particularly after prolonged exposure over time. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is generally not communicable. HIV-infected individuals are more likely to develop TB.
Only ardeid birds and pigs have a sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. The mosquito picks up the virus from the blood of a viremic host. After a few days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host when bitten. Humans are incidental and dead-end hosts as viremia does not reach sufficient levels to infect mosquitoes.
ICD-9 117.3; ICD-10 B48.4
Reducing sexual transmission through the promotion ofmonogamy, condom use, male circumcision, and the detection and treatment of STIs; raising awareness of individual HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing; protecting IVDUs through needle/syringe exchange and methadone replacement programs; reducing mother to child transmission through voluntary counseling and testing and the provision of ARVs.
Avoid contact with armadillos or their habitat.
Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features. The bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis.
Anthrax
Serology (IF, EIA); PCR; culture in mice or cell lines.
Indefinite and variable; from skin penetration to larvae in the stool takes 2–4 weeks.
Ivermectin, given as a single, oral dose annually or every 6 months. There is a risk of SAEs in patients coinfected with L. loa. Doxycycline gives good results by destroying the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria and has fewer side effects. Surgical removal of subcutaneous nodules.
IgM serology on paired sera; specific identification to subtype by virus isolation; RT-PCR.
Histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) African histoplasmosis. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. The acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. Severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. Osteomyelitis is rare. Disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. It presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, CNS and GI tract being the most affected. Disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. Past infection results in partial protection. Reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
Unknown.

ICD-9 100; ICD-10 A27
A granulomatous fungal infection of the lung, skin, bone or genitourinary tract. Pulmonary infection may be acute or chronic. Acute: fever, cough and pulmonary infiltrate, resolving in 1–3 weeks. Chronic infection is more common and characterized by erythematous papules on the face and extremities, low-grade fever, and weight loss; pulmonary infection may cavitate. Occasionally bone, prostate, epididymis and central nervous system may be affected. Untreated disseminated or chronic pulmonary disease is generally fatal. The main differential diagnosis is tuberculosis.
Deer and dogs (E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii). The whitetailed deer is a complete host for maintaining the transmission cycle of E. chaffeensis. Deer, ruminants, and field rodents (A. phagocytophilum); unknown for N. sennetsu; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
Spherical, enveloped orthobunyaviruses with single-stranded, negative-sense, tripartite RNA genomes, with con-siderable recognized reassortment. The name derives from the original classification of arthropod-borne viruses in to A, B and C groups. Group C viruses can be divided into four complexes: (1) Caraparu complex [Apeu virus (APEUV), Bruconha virus (BRCV), Caraparu virus (CARV), Ossa virus (OSSAV), and Vinces virus (VINV)]; (2) Madrid virus (MADV); (3) Marituba complex viruses [Gumbo Limbo virus (GLV), Marituba virus (MTBV), Murutucu virus (MURV), Nepuyo virus (NEPV), Restan virus (RESV)], and (4) Oriboca complex viruses [Itaqui (ITQV), Oriboca viruses (ORIV)].

Supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin G, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
Bilharziasis, snail fever, Katayama fever or syndrome, intestinal schistosomiasis.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro, Ross River, and o’nyong-nyong viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago, with spread to Asia within the last century.
Chloroquine is effective; primaquine is likely unnecessary as a gametocidal drug since gametocytes appear to be sensitive to chloroquine.
TB is a major cause of death and disability world wide, especially in developing countries. Morbidity and mortality rates increase with age, and are higher in males. In regions of high incidence, morbidity peaks in adults of working age. Morbidity is higher in urban populations, among the poor, and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks. There were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of TB in the world in 2007 (14% HIV positive), an almost 50% increase from 1990, and an estimated onethird of the world’s population is either latently or actively infected with TB. Most of the cases in 2007 were in Asia (55%) and Africa (31%). MDR-TB is a serious problem in Russia, former Russian republics, India and China. In 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million MDR-TB cases. By 2008, 55 countries reported at least one XDR-TB case.
Average 7–10 days (range 5–21 days).

Serology (IFA on acute and convalescent serum); cross-reactivity occurs. Microscopy of blood or bone marrow smears is insensitive; PCR on acute phase whole blood; isolation by cell culture in reference labs.
Via a bite or a scratch by an infected host animal. Human infection via S. moniliformis ingestion (milk, water, food) is known as Haverhill fever. Some streptobacillosis cases may occur by close contact with the oral flora of pet rats through kissing and sharing food. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
Hard ticks (Ixodidae). Depending on the tick species, they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia, or via venereal, transovarial, and trans-stadial passage. Animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage.Rodent hosts include ground squirrels, mice, and voles.
By mosquito bite. Transfused red cells, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma from infected donors can transmit WNV; transmission has also been reported more rarely through organ transplantation, blood transfusion, and mother-to-child. Laboratory infections have occurred from aerosols and percutaneous exposures.
An inactivated virus vaccine (not licenced) is limited available to protect laboratory workers, veterinarians and others ‘at risk.’ Livestock vaccines are available, but are not licenced in Europe or the USA. Animal movement should be banned during outbreaks. Protective clothing worn by those exposed to infected animals/tissue. All animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating. Infection control for those taking care of severe human cases. Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Larviciding at mosquito-breeding sites. Early warning systems for RVF are in place that use satellite images and weather/climate forecasting data.
Unknown.

Humans are the main reservoir. Subclinical infection is likely common in endemic areas, as M. leprae DNA can be found in nasal swabs in up to 5% of healthy individuals in Asian endemic regions. Subclinical infection generally does not develop into clinical disease. Natural infection occurs in armadillos and several primates.
Bartonellosis, Bartonella quintana
Amphotericin B iv or itraconazole. Long-term azole maintenance treatment is required in HIV patients to prevent relapses.
L. monocytogenes can be detected from blood and CSF by microscopy/culture or PCR. MRI is indicated for suspected brainstem infection (rhombencephalitis). Serology is not useful for diagnosis.
Sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CVV rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995.
By airborne droplets from respiratory secretions of infected persons. Subclinical cases can transmit infection. Rubella virusmay be transmitted to the fetus if the mother is infected during pregnancy.
None.
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. BCG vaccination provides variable protection: from 34% to 80%. Chemoprophylaxis and quarantine are not recommended. M. leprae bacilli remain viable for 9 days in dried nasal secretions and about 6 weeks in moist soil.
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. Skin lesions are often symmetric. Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. Up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.
ICD-9 121.3; ICD-10 B66.3
Weil disease, swamp fever, cane cutters disease, hemorrhagic jaundice, swineherd disease.
Together with tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, penicilliosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in Southeast Asia. Though we could not find a report from Myanmar, it is expected to be present there. In northern Thailand it causes 15% of the HIV-related diseases. Before the HIV epidemic it was a rare disease in immunocompromised patients residing in endemic areas in Asia. Cases of penicilliosis have been described world wide, mainly in HIV patients with a travel history to endemic regions. A single case has been described from Ghana where there was no clear travel history to Southeast Asia. The association between bamboo rats and human infection is unclear. There is an association between infection risk and doing agricultural work, suggesting that soil exposure is a risk factor. The disease has a seasonal pattern with more cases during the rainy season.
By insect bite.
A combination of several ARVs is recommended, known as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). Additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections, general measures to maintain nutrition and health, and treatment of specific infections or HIV-associated disorders.
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. The disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. However, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley. Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.

ICD-9 528.1; ICD-10 A69.0
World wide there are approximately 1.5 million new cases of CL per year, with most cases reported from Afghanistan, Algeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria in the Old World. The highest burden of CL in the Old Word is in rural semi-arid and desert regions, but transmission is being increasingly seen in peri-urban and urban environments. Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is likely related to the short flight range of sandflies.
B. pseudomallei is a soil and water saprophyte and can survive for long periods in moist soil and mammalian tissues. Infection has been found in a wide range of animals, but none is thought to be a reservoir host.

ICD-9 027.0; ICD-10 A 32.1
Trench fever is named afterinfected soldiers in the trenches during World War I. Little data exist on the incidence and distribution of B. quintana infections. Infections have been reported from every continent. Trench fever is a sign of social turmoil and personal hardship. For instance, an epidemic of trench fever erupted in a refugee camp in Burundi. In Europe and North America, B. quintana infections are associated with poverty, alcoholism, and homelessness, known as urban trench fever. Crowded and unhygienic living conditions facilitate exposure of B. quintana infected individuals to lice that subsequently pass on the infection to others. Trench fever is a re-emerging disease due to the increase in homeless people and HIV-infected individuals.
Hookworm
Donovanosis
Blood culture with prolonged incubation (42 days); lysis centrifugation blood culture systems or subculture of blood culture bottles onto fresh chocolate agar enhances sensitivity. Several serological assays are available (CFT, ELISA, IFA), but cross-reactivity occurs; PCR on blood and tissue.

Serology or RT-PCR on blood or CSF; virus isolation.
There are two different groups of etiologic agents: fungi and bacteria. Fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma, and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated. The fungi Madurella mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma. Bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated, of which the bacterial species of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma.

Praziquantel is the drug of choice for all.
Mumps
None.
Most South and several Central American countries between 23 N and 34 S have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions, particularly Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Argentina. The prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75% in adults, with active disease developing in approximately 2% of infected individuals. The endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams, mild temperatures, a short winter, and a summer with moderate rain. The disease mainly affects active rural workers (coffee, cotton, and tobacco farmers), probably due to environmental exposure. This explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years. Postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form. Contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis.
Freshwater snails: Semisulcospira, Thiara, Aroapyrgus, and others.
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, cases have decreased significantly. There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. In 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC. This illustrates the difficulties of the global polio eradication program. Risk is seasonal in the temperate climates, with highest risks during the warmer months.
Tetanus spores enter the body through wounds and under anaerobic conditions, the spores germinate and produce toxin. The toxins are disseminated via the blood and lymphatic system and bind to nerve endings, preventing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. This results in unopposed skeletal muscle contraction.
ICD-9 085.0; IDC-10 B55.0
Personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places).
Human infections occur via two main transmission routes: (1) mosquito bite, and (2) direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (e.g. slaughtering, butchering, veterinary procedures, animal births, disposing of carcasses or fetuses) by percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols. Transmissionmay be possible via consumption of raw milk of an infected animal. Person-toperson transmission has not been described. However, humans develop high viral loads in the blood, and may transmit virus to contacts.
Blastomycosis is a sporadic disease with a worldwide distribution, though most cases are reported from North America. It is endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio river basins and around the Great Lakes. In endemic areas blastomycosis is frequent in dogs but rare in cats and other animals. The annual incidence of blastomycosis in northern Wisconsin is estimated to be 40–100 per 100,000 in humans and 1,400 per 100,000 in dogs. In the USA outbreaks are usually seen in the spring and fall, indicating infection 1–3 months earlier. Cases are commoner in males and the disease is rare in children. Blastomycosis occurs close to rivers and lakes with changing water levels. Activities involving shores or waterways, like fishing and canoeing, are identified as risk factors for infection.
1–4 days for pneumonic, 2–7 days for bubonic plague.
The disease ecology is not completely understood. Humans are likely dead end hosts.

ICD-9 125.7; ICD-10 B72
Direct contact of abraded skin or conjunctival mucosa to urine of infected animals or exposure to environmental sources where urine is deposited. Infection via ingestion is uncommon.
Humans are the only known reservoir host.
3–35 days; 6–20 for paralytic cases.
ICD-9 062; ICD-10 A83.2
Hard ticks (Ixodidae). The brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), the principal vector of MSF, ISF, ITT, and AF, is most active during spring and summer, has a low human affinity, and prefers dogs in a peridomestic environment. The southern African bont tick (Amblyomma hebraeum) and A. africanum are the principal vectors of R. africae in southern Africa. A. hebraeum is an aggressive, human-biting tick and has high rates of rickettsia infection, and ATBF cases therefore often occur in clusters. See key references for further reading on ticks and tick-borne rickettsioses.
Personal anti-tick precautions. An inactivated mouse-brain vaccine is in use in Russia and eastern Europe. Healthcare workers caring for CCHF patients are at risk and need to take proper barrier precautions.
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes; drinking contaminated water (less common).
Taeniosis: praziquantel. Neurocysticercosis: Treatment must be individualized case by case but could include cestocidal drugs (albendazole or praziquantel), symptomatic measures (antiepileptic drugs, oedema reducing drugs, ventriculoperitoneal shunt) and removal by neurosurgery (limited indications).
Brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. From infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
Livestock (cattle, camels, goats, sheep), wild buffalo, waterbuck, some rodents.
None.
Various vaccines are available; personal antimosquito precautions; intermittent irrigation of rice fields disrupts vector breeding; vaccination of pigs reduces amplification.
It is estimated that more than 207 million people are infected world wide, with 85% of them in Africa. Infection does not produce full immunity, so reinfection occurs. Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. Higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to irrigation projects or dams. Man-made water bodies like dams can lead to changes in snail habitat and cause a shift from urogenital to intestinal schistosomiasis (Egypt) and vice versa (Senegal). S. mansoni was presumably introduced with the slave trade from west Africa into South America and the Caribbean S. intercalatum and S. guineensis are geographically restricted to Central Western Africa.
Hendra virus: pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic. The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine. The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear. All human cases had close contact with infected horses. Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season. In Malaysia, it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms, and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs, who became infected. Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand, and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India, in the absence of reported pig or human disease. In Bangladesh, there is epidemiologic evidence of bat–human transmission without an intermediate livestock host, and of human–human transmission. Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease. Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor. Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar (Pteropus and Eidolon sp.) and in Ghana (Eidolon sp.), but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection, it is not possible to know which virus is involved. No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa.
ICD-9 063; ICD-10 A84.0, A84.1
Recovery of S. pneumoniae from sputum, blood, CSF or other normally sterile fluids by culture or PCR. S. pneumoniae antigen test in urine.
Vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccine should be routine for children (minimum age: 12 months), preferably with the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), with a booster at age 4 to 6 years. Infected children should be kept out of school and away from other child contacts. Displaced persons (e.g. refugees) should be vaccinated within a week of their arrival in a camp. For postexposure prophylaxis, vaccination is recommended within 72 hours of exposure, with a booster in 5–6 weeks; human immunoglobulin for immunocompromised persons and those for whom vaccine is contraindicated.
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.

The vector defecates during feeding, and the infected feces are rubbed into the bite wound or conjunctivae, mucousmembranes, or abraded skin; blood transfusion, organ transplant and shared needles. Congenital infection occurs in 2–8% of infected pregnancies. Oral transmission occurs by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink.
ICD-9 114; ICD-10 B38
Praziquantel or niclosamide.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
Supportive, including rehydration.
Mainly presents as a dry skin lesion that is covered with a crust and is smaller than the classic wet leishmania skin lesions in the New World. Lesions may persist for months or years. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis may be seen with L. aethiopica; leishmaniasis recidivans may be seen with L. tropica. Mucosal leishmaniasis is rare in the Old World, and more common in the Americas.
WHO recommended regimen (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course or DOTS) is 2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin plus isoniazid. If resistance to rifampicin or isoniazid is suspected, treatment must continue with second-line drugs for at least 18 months. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR and XDR-TB) require special regimens. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to two main first-line TB drugs: isoniazid and rifampicin. XDR-TB (Extensive Drug Resistant TB) is defined as MDR-TB with resistance to fluoroquinolones and one second-line injectable drug.
It takes about 10 months for L3 to develop into adults. After 12–18 months microfilariae are found in the skin.
By ingestion of infected copepods, usually with drinking water.
By sexual contact. In children with no history of abuse, the route of transmission is unclear. Several reported pediatric cases have been in contact with infected adults, but without evidence of sexual contact.
Rabbit fever, deerfly fever, hare fever, lemming fever, Ohara fever, Francis disease.
No proven treatment available.
None.
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. Larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. Epizootic or epidemic VEE viruses belong to subtypes IAB and IC. Enzootic VEE complex viruses belong to subtypes II to VI and ID, IE, and IF.With the exception of IE strains, these do not cause disease in equids, but can cause sporadic disease in humans. VEEV is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
Two interacting cycles can be distinguished: (1) a persistent cycle in the aquatic reservoir, and (2) in the human host, leading to amplification through fecal–oral spread.
Several species of Paragonimus trematode flatworms: P. westermani, P. heterotremus, P. miyazakii, P. skrjabini, and P. hueitungensis (the last two may be the same) in Asia, P. africanus and P. uterobilateralis in Africa, P. mexicanus (P. peruvianus) and P. kellicotti in the Americas.
WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns. In countries where prevalence is low: WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns.
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine fever, Mucambo virus fever.
Infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound. The tabanid bite is painful with blood loss.
Not completely understood. Possibly in the soil the fungus produces infective propagula that can become airborne, inhaled, and lead to respiratory infection. Infections may also occur through traumatic lesions, but this has not been demonstrated.
Cutaneous anthrax: penicillin, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po; severe anthrax (GI or inhalation): ciprofloxacin iv preferred. Clindamycin can inhibit toxin production.
Repeated direct contact with infected secretions from infected individual (mainly from eye to nose); also by hands and fomites (shared clothes, towels, or bedlinen). Flies also play a role in the transmission. High risk of infection in close contacts of infected individuals.
Coxiellosis, Query fever.
In 2000, WHO started the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis that aims to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity. Endemic areas are mapped with subsequent mass treatment for the population at-risk (see Therapy) for 5 years. Care needs to be taken in loiasis endemic areas to prevent adverse events (see Loiasis map); vector control (e.g. bed nets, repellent).
Estimated to be at least 8 days.
There is a vaccine against Junin virus only. Targeted rodent control in houses, except for Junin virus, which is spread by rodents in the fields. Barrier nursing of cases.
For interrupting transmission: mass treatment with a single dose of albendazole or ivermectin combined with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) once a year for at least 5 years; or the regular intake of DEC-fortified salt for at least one year; individual treatment: DEC can worsen onchocercal eye disease and cause serious adversere actions in patients with loiasis. Pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is largely due to the immune response to their endosymbiotic Wolbachiabacteria, therefore doxycycline may be used. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery.
By consumption of infected raw, salted, marinated, pickled or undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish. Infected humans can excrete worm eggs in sputum and feces for up to 20 years. There is no person-to-person transmission.
In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. In developed countries (prior to immunization), Hib was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in young children, but in countries with high vaccination coverage Hib is now almost eliminated as a public health problem. In developing countries Hib meningitis is common but Hib pneumonia appears to be even more common, with pneumonia morbidity and mortality exceeding that of meningitis. In 2000 Hib is estimated to have caused around 8 million cases of severe invasive disease and 360,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. Ten countries, all in Africa and Asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these Hib deaths. Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16% of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children, therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa. Global coverage with three doses of Hib vaccine was estimated at 28% in 2008, with overall coverage of around 90% in the Americas, 65% in Europe, 40% in Africa, and less than 5% in Asia and the Pacific. The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009, in 83% of WHO Member States (160/193), Hib is included in the national immunization schedule.
Most infections with S. stercoralis are asymptomatic. Symptoms may include: upper abdominal pain; cough; diarrhea; a red and painful, creeping urticarial eruption on the skin; and vomiting. Pulmonary symptoms (including Loeffler syndrome) can occur. Disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs in immunocompromised patients and presents with abdominal pain, distension, shock, pulmonary and neurologic complications, and septicemia. High mortality rates (15–87%) have been described in patients with disseminated disease.
ICD-9 060; ICD-10 A95
Plague
The distribution of RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis is limited by the tick vector distribution. Average annual RMSF incidence of the disease in the USA was 2.2 cases per million between 1997 and 2002, and approximately 250–1,200 cases are reported each year. Many cases of RMSF may actually have been caused by other rickettsial agents, as was seen with R. parkeri. Many rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity are present in ticks and new disease causing agents are still being discovered. RMSF in the USA follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months, when ticks are most active. RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas, and less commonly in urban areas. Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF. RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters.
TBE, Western, European or Central European tick-borne encephalitis, Siberian tick-borne encephalitis, Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis), diphasic milk fever, diphasic meningoencephalitis
Breakbone fever.
Microscopy of infected tissue in which typical intracellular yeast cells are found; culture of blood, bone marrow, skin lesion, or lymph node.
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
There is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito. The mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites, which, after release, infect erythrocytes. The erythrocytic stages multiply around 10-fold every 48-hours. Erythrocytes can release gametocytes which infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. In the mosquito, gametocytes develop into sporozoites.
Rabies
Malaria, Plasmodium falciparum
Usually 2–4 weeks (days to 2 months).
Amebiasis, amebic dysentery, amebic liver abscess, ameboma, amoebiasis.
16–22 days, occasionally up to 7 months.
Bite of infected larval mites (chiggers). There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Up to one-third of cases are subclinical. The illness begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and headache followed by unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral tender swelling of the parotid (parotitis) or other salivary glands. Parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. Infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis, which is seen in up to 10% of cases but is self-limiting and does not result in death of disability. Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
Hard ticks (Ixodidae). Depending on the tick species, they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia, or via venereal, transovarial, and transstadial passage. Animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage. Hosts include dogs, rodents, and other animals.
Enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
The fungus grows as a mycelium in the environment and in human or animal tissue it converts into a budding yeast.
Range from asymptomatic pulmonary consolidation to mild bronchitis, through acute pneumonic or rapidly fatal septicemic presentations to chronic suppurative infection. Pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and empyema may also be seen. Easily confused clinically with typhoid fever and tuberculosis, and laboratories may not recognize the causative organism and report it as a contaminant.
Treat patients to reduce the T. b. gambiense reservoir, and cattle to reduce the T. b. rhodesiense reservoir; screen blood donations; vector control: fly traps, insecticide-treated screens, ground and aerial spraying, release of sterile male tsetse flies.
6–16 days.
None.
WEEV was first isolated during an equine epizootic in California in 1930. Eight years later WEEV was isolated from a fatal humanWEE case in California. TheWEEV distribution is limited to the Americas with human epidemics occurring in North America west of the Mississippi river and Brazil. WEEV does not occur at higher altitudes in the Rocky Mountains. In the USA it overlaps with eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in Texas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Michigan. It is absent from Central America (except Veracruz, Mexico). In South America, WEEV epizootics occur periodically in northern Argentina. The WEEV vector, Culex tarsalis, is associated with irrigated agriculture and stream drainages. The WEEV cycle in warmer regions is maintained and in colder areas it can be reintroduced by migratory birds or remain in an unknown reservoir host species. Between 1964 and 2005, there were 639 confirmed human WEE cases in the USA. In temperate regions the disease is seasonal with cases appearing during the warmer summer months. The incidence declined to less than 10 cases per year since 1988.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using reduced osmolarity ORS; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
Before 2004, CHIKV was considered a minor arboviral disease, but since then has spread globally, infecting millions of people. Most cases are symptomatic. CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. CHIKV spread to Asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks, similar to dengue fever, involving Ae. egypti. The global epidemic started since a mutation in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein gene (A226V) occurred, that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by Ae. albopictus. The mutated CHIKV is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present. In 2005–2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. Since 2006, CHIKV outbreaks with are reported from several (sub)tropical countries in the new world. CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy. CHIKV-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous CHIKV-free areas if Ae. albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present.
Ebola viruses: unknown route. Bats have not yet been implicated in the initiation of ebola outbreaks. However, most outbreaks are associated with the consumption or contact with diverse non-human primates, suggesting that transmission could occur from bats to monkeys to humans; exposure to contaminated body fluids; by direct person-toperson contact; via injection with re-used syringes; preparing bodies of cases for burial. Marburg viruses: most outbreaks are associated with index cases visiting caves or working in mines. As Egyptian fruit bats are cave animals, transmission may occur directly from bats to humans or via contact with their excreta and secreta; transmission between humans is similar as for ebola virus. ‘Cuevaviruses’ are probably apathogenic for humans.
Humans.
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.0
Hib is transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.
Sudden onset fever (may be diphasic), headache, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, dizziness, chills, and photophobia. Also nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric and eye pain, conjunctivitis, and meningitis have been reported. Recently, spontaneous hemorrhagic phenomena were reported in human cases. The disease is self-limiting, there are no reports of OROV related deaths.

Malaria, Plasmodium ovale
Loss of appetite, epigastric discomfort, rarely jaundice due to bile duct obstruction, cirrhosis, liver enlargement, ascites and edema. After years of chronic infection there is a risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
The impact of sanitation, footwear, and health education is minimal. To reduce the disease burden of STHs, mass treatment campaigns with benzimidazoles and praziquantel are undertaken, and sanitation and access to clean water improved. As most STHs occur in children, control efforts are targeted at schools. Infective larvae can survive in soil for several months.

ICD-9 084.3; ICD-10 B53.0
A progressive chronic illness of the skin and mucous membranes in the genital and perigenital regions with painless granulomatous ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy. Nodular skin lesions can appear as lymphadenopathy, known as ‘pseudobulbar.’ The painless lesions are often found in warm moist body regions and bleed easily. Lesions can be progressive and cause local tissue destruction. Systemic spread is rare but bones and internal organs may eventually be infected.
During blood meal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses that cause HPS were discovered in 1993; more than 30 new hantaviruses have been detected since then, but not all cause HPS.There at least 14 hantaviruses that cause HPS in the Americas: Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family.

It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in Africa, and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen. Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade. Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
Early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). Proper bodily hygiene.
Freshwater (pond) snails (Lymnaeidae).
Avoid exposure to feces of reservoir species wash hands, fruit and vegetables, periodically treat high-risk dogs, eliminate ownerless dogs. Praziquantel-containing baits have reduced infection in urban foxes and water voles in Switzerland and Germany. Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation, but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol.
Through wounds on the skin, including minor abrasions. Infection via ingestion of contaminated improperly cooked pork products. No human-to-human transmission.
A killed vaccine is available for laboratory workers, but is not recommended for use in epidemics. In buildings or rodent burrows, flea control with insecticide should be followed by rat destruction (killing rats liberates fleas); rat control in ports and ships. Chemoprophylaxis of pneumonic plague contacts. Pneumonic cases should be isolated.
Sheep, cattle, water buffalo, and other large herbivores. Occasionally humans.
Virus detection by RT-PCR of respiratory specimens is recommended; virus culture requires a BSL-3 facility. Microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to A/H5N1. Rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity.
Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and S. rasyani in Yemen. In Latin America: Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and
Snail–human–snail. Infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water, enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver. When matured to adult male and female worms, they migrate to the abdominal veins (S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, S. guineensis) or pelvic veins (S. haematobium), mate and produce eggs. Snails remain infectious for up to 3 months, humans for more than 10 years.
C. botulinum spores are found in soil, dust, honey, marine sediments, and in intestines of fish and land animals.
Oropouche Virus Disease
Serology (IgM and IgG ELISA) on acute and convalescent sera; cross-reactivity exists leading to misidentification. RT-PCR has been used to test human brain tissue samples.
Trematode worms Schistosoma japonicum, S. malayensis, and S. mekongi.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; residual spraying of insecticides; treatment of infected humans. Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort. Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO.

Human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1
Usually 2–3 days.
ICD-9 116.0; ICD-10 B40
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for 3 to 7 days post illness onset. The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, after which it can infect another human by bite.
Ebola viruses, except RESTV, are endemic in the tropical rain forests of equatorial Africa. Most outbreaks started from a single case admitted to a hospital that had inadequate infection control, resulting in rapid nosocomial transmission. Cases have been imported from endemic countries into South Africa and Switzerland, and laboratory infections have occurred in the UK and Russia. Marburg viruses are endemic in arid woodlands of equatorial Africa. Outbreaks are usually limited to a few cases, with the exception of one outbreak in the DRC and Angola. Cases have been imported into South Africa, the Netherlands, and possibly the USA. A laboratory outbreak in 1967 in Germany and in Yugoslavia, led to the discovery of the disease (not shown on the map).
Consumption of raw, undercooked, dried, salted, or pickled freshwater fish. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Serology (IgM ELISA or EIA); RT-PCR on blood in early phase of disease; virus isolation in specialized laboratories.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the Lentivirus genus and Retroviridae family, is divided into two main species HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more infectious and more virulent than HIV-2 and predominates globally, with HIV-2 transmission restricted to parts of Western and Central Africa.
TBRF is primarily transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks. LBRF is transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus); neither the head louse nor the pubic louse has been shown to transmit the disease.

Descending flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis beginning at the shoulders in the absence of fever; fatigue, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, dry mouth, difficulty in speaking and swallowing, progressing to an inability to breathe without assistance. Vomiting, diarrhea or constipation may occur. The CFR in the USA after treatment is 5–10%; recovery may take months. Infants present with constipation, anorexia, weakness, an altered cry, difficulty sucking, and swallowing. Muscle weakness progresses in a symmetric descending fashion over hours to a few days. The prognosis is excellent when treated timely.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus
During bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis
Hendra virus: manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover, regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring, regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks. Nipah virus: avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges; wash and peel fruit, and wash hands before and after preparing fruit; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas.

Forest rodents, marsupials, and bats.
Sheep liver fluke disease, pharyngeal fascioliasis.
Clinical diagnosis of active disease by presence of follicles and papillae on the conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid. Trichiasis and corneal opacity are also diagnosed clinically. Presence or absence of infecting agent (by any method, including PCR) has poor correlation with presence or absence of disease or its severity; serology has no diagnostic value.
Unclear, but likely through inhalation of P. marneffei conidia from the environment; cutaneous inoculation may also occur. There is no human-to-human transmission.
Standard louse control and personal tick protection. Chemoprophylaxis may be used for bite victims.
The sandfly Lutzomyia verrucarum. Preferred habitat: narrow river gorges at elevations between 500 and 3,200 meters.
A large number of infective mosquito bites are necessary to establish infection.
B. quintana multiplies in the louse’s intestine and is excreted in the feces. Body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching, by which the skin is inoculated with louses’ contaminated feces. Chronic B. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread.
Sleeping sickness, Gambian trypanosomiasis, Rhodesian trypanosomiasis, West African sleeping sickness, East African sleeping sickness.
Microscopy of fresh skin snips to detect microfilariae. Nodule palpation. Rapid card tests based on antibody detection have been produced with promising results (but not yet available commercially). Luciferase immunoprecipitation system with a mixture of four O. volvulus antigens. Less-invasive techniques for disease surveillance are diethylcarbamazine patch tests (may become commercially available in near future), which provoke a local Mazzotti skin reaction.

ICD-9 122.7; ICD-10 B67.5–B67.7
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. In humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
For C. philippinensis: sanitation and avoid consumption of raw or improperly cooked fish.
vCJD is characterized by a relatively early age of onset (28 years) and prominent early psychiatric symptoms: anxiety, depression, agitation, delusions, and unpleasant sensory symptoms. Neurological features are: unsteadiness, difficulty walking, and involuntary movements. Memory loss progresses to severe cognitive impairment and, at the time of death, patients have become unable to move or speak. The median duration of illness is 14 months.
Bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular Gramnegative bacterium.
By tick bites, except for N. sennetsu, which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts. No person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion.
Avian Influenza (A/H5N1)
There is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses. Group C viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, and were first described in the Brazilian Amazon in the 1950s. Studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts, leading to genetic reassortment. Genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the Americas. Nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported, from Mexico to Brazil. There is no sex or age preference for infection. Inapparent and mild infections are common, overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Listeria bacteria in the environment or food are ingested by ruminants and humans, colonize the intestine and shed again into the environment with the feces. L. monocytogenes is able to cross the intestinal mucosa under specific conditions, resulting in systemic disease or hematogeneous spread to the central nervous system and, in the case of pregnancy, fetus.
Supportive for acute hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha and reverse transcriptase inhibitors for chronic hepatitis B. Treatment response, particularly interferon treatment, differs by HBV genotype. Treatment is expensive and often not available in developing countries. In Southeast Asia, medicinal herbs are widely used to treat chronic HBV disease, of which the efficacy is yet unclear. Liver transplant is possible for decompensated cirrhosis.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment. Ribavirin may limit the severity and improve the prognosis of LACV infections. Anticonvulsant medication in those with seizures.
Mosquitoes of more than 40 species, principally of the genus Culex, but also Anopheles, Aedes and others. Some vector species can shift their feeding preference from birds to humans, depending on the season (e.g. Culex pipiens). The main vectors in the USA are: Culex pipiens (Eastern), Culex tarsalis(Midwest andWest), and Culex quinquefasciatus(Southeast). In Europe two populations of Culex pipiens exist: one that feeds on birds and the other on humans.

None.
MAYV is enzootic in the humid tropical rainforests of South America. Infections peak in the rainy season when the mosquito vectors are most abundant. Most human cases occur sporadically and involve persons who work or reside in humid tropical forest; several small outbreaks of Mayaro fever have been described in residents of rural communities of the Amazon region of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. Travelers have imported MAYV from Surinam to the Netherlands and from Brazil into France. The virus has been detected in migratory birds.
Secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole. HIV patients with low CD4 counts should avoid endemic areas.
Ebola viruses: possibly fruit bats, unknown for BDBV, SUDV, and TAFV; Marburg viruses: infectious MARV and RAVV have been isolated from Egyptian fruit bats; ‘Cuevaviruses’: Schreiber’s long-fingered bats.
Serology is mainly used (immunodiffusion and CF tests). Detection of antigen in blood, CSF, urine or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by radioimmunoassay. Microscopy on Giemsa stained bone-marrow or blood smear. Histoplasma skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed. PCR-based tests are available. Fungal culture is generally slow.
Third generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone or cefotaxime). Other beta-lactam antibiotics may be used in case the organism is susceptible, like amoxicillin. Alternative agents are: fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines.
Oroya fever, Carrión disease, verruga peruana (Peruvian wart).
2–21 days.
ICD-9 088.8; ICD-10 B60.0
Eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail, where they develop to cercariae that encyst on aquatic plants (e.g. watercress) and become desiccation resistant metacercariae. After the plants are eaten by herbivores (e.g. sheep, cattle), or water containing metacercariae is drunk, the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, enter the liver, and lay eggs in the bile duct, which are then excreted in the feces. The whole cycle takes 3 to 4 months.
Uruma fever.
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA of erythrocytes). Diagnosis is confirmed by a significant ( > 4-fold) change in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. Virus isolation or RNA detection by RT-PCR from the blood or CSF.
By bite or direct percutaneous contact, mucosal or respiratory exposure to blood, tissues, fluids or lesions of infected animals. In Africa, transmission mainly occurs through butchering infected wildlife for food. Person-to-person transmission probably occurs through direct contact with infected tissue/fluid, respiratory droplet spread, and indirect via contaminated objects.
By mosquito bite.
The only real reservoir is the tick. Viremia persists only for a few days in transmission competent vertebrates, rodents (mainly Apodemus spp.). Deer, birds, possibly marmots are not competent to transmit to ticks.

12 to 20 days, up to to several months
Humans. Asymptomatic carriage of N.meningitidis in the oropharynx is common, although carriage rates vary widely by geographic and epidemiological setting. The carrier state is immunizing and development of meningococcal disease is associated with recent acquisition.
Sandfly control with residual insecticide; avoid endemic areas after sunset; use insect repellents and covering clothes; insecticide-treated bednets. Active case finding in households where cases occur. Vector-control efforts should target the homes of incident case patients. Patients should be kept in sandfly-proof wards.

Gram stain and microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid, and culture. Latex agglutination tests for detection of group-specific capsular polysaccharide. PCR.
‘Classic’ trench fever is characterized by febrile attacks that last 1 to 3 days, with headache, shin pain, and dizziness. The attacks recur every 4 to 6 days, with succeeding attacks being less severe; no deaths have been reported. ‘Urban’ trench fever generally occurs generally in homeless people and clincal features are highly variable, including severe disease with endocarditis, non-specific symptoms with or without fever, and chronic asymptomatic bacteremia. Infection with B. quintana (or B. henselae) may also cause bacillary angiomatosis, usually in patients with HIV.
Loa loa filariasis, loiasis, African eyeworm, Calabar swelling
3–14 days (usually 4–7 days).
Cave disease, Ohio valley disease, reticuloendotheliosis, African histoplasmosis.
The name means ‘joint-breaker’ in the Acholi language of Africa.
Yellow Fever
Infection is often asymptomatic but as the adult worms live for 5–10 years, some will develop painful swelling (sometimes enormous) of legs or arms, and, in cases of Bancroftian filariasis, the breasts or scrotum (hydrocele). Up to 40% have renal involvement. Acute cases may have high fever, recurrent lymphadenitis, and retrograde lymphangitis.
Sindbis Fever
Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, angiostrongyliasis
Monkeys, three-toed sloths (Bradypus tridactylus), marsupials, and forest birds.
Mayaro Fever
Humans are the natural host. Numerous mammals have serologic evidence of HEV disease, including but not limited to: pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, macaques, cats, dogs, rabbits, mongoose, deer, wild boar, rats, and mice. HEV in pigs is asymptomatic, but there is transient viremia and excretion of virus into the environment.
Monkeypox
A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs. Postauricular, occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5–10 days. Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children. Arthropathy may occur, especially in young women. The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy. CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness, cataract, cardiac abnormalities, and a range of neurological impairments.
Need to treat both P. ovale blood and liver stage with chloroquine (blood stage) and primaquine (liver stage).
Leprosy
Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae (see also Bunyavirus Group C map). Bunyamwera group viruses that can cause human disease in Africa are: Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family
Serological tests cross-react with HTLV-2, requiring positive ELISA to be confirmed by Western blot, IFA, or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA); RT-PCR.
Humans are the only natural host. The parasite can be experimentally transferred to chimpanzees.
Group A rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations. Rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of <5 years. The incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries, but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure. Control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access, hygiene, and sanitation. Rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease. For vaccine introduction, knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed. The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (G1–G4 and G9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with G1[P8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but only 30% of infections in South America, Asia, and Africa.

Trypanosomiasis, American
Humans.
Mosquito bite. Direct person-to-person transmission has not been documented.
Penicillium marneffei, a dimorphic fungus. It is the only Penicillium species that is dimorphic: at body temperature or 37 C it is a yeast form and at cooler temperature it grows as a mold.
Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g. semen, vaginal fluid, saliva) of an infected individual. Person-to-person transmission via sexual contact, needle sharing in IVDUs, sharing toothbrushes or razors, and blood transfusion. Transmission does not occur via kissing, coughing, or sneezing. Mother to child transmission occurs mainly during birth or transplacentally (not via breastfeeding).
Animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
Respiratory diphtheria is classically associated with fever, inflammation of the pharynx or larynx, pseudomembrane formation, lymphadenopathy and edema of the soft tissues of the neck. However, most cases are mild and may resemble streptococcal pharyngitis and the pseudomembrane may be absent. The exotoxin of C. diphtheriae can cause polyneuritis and myocarditis. Nasal diphtheria is usually mild and chronic with nasal discharge and ulceration. Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic, sharply demarcated ulcers with an adherent gray pseudomembrane. It is usually associated with skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci.
ICD-9 123.1; ICD-10 B 69.0
Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries and territories; world wide, more than 55,000 people die of rabies every year; 40% of people who are bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age. Dogs are the source of 99% of human rabies deaths, which is largely due to low rabies vaccination coverage of dogs in developing countries. Most cases of rabies in North America and Australia have been acquired from bats, often with no documented record of a bite. The USA was declared free of canine rabies transmission in 2007. In the Americas, dog rabies control reduced human cases to 16 by 2009. Every year, more than 15 million people world wide receive a preventive PEP regimen to avert the disease – this is estimated to prevent more than 327,000 rabies deaths annually.
ICD-9 070.5; ICD-10 B17.1 and B18.2.
Food for canning or bottling should be thoroughly cooked; consumption of inadequately smoked or salted food and uneviscerated fish should be avoided. Also avoid honey and dusty excavation sites with infants. A pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) vaccine is available from the CDC.
Haemophilus influenzae, a Gram-negative bacterium that can be uncapsulated or capsulated. Capsulated strains are classified into serotypes a–f. H. influenzaetype b (Hib) is the most pathogenic serotype.
Tuberculosis
Infections are generally asymptomatic to mild. WEE can present as an influenza-like illness with sudden onset fever, severe headache, chills, and myalgia. Other symptoms are: retro-orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The disease can progress to more severe disease with encephalitis and death. Encephalitis occurs in about 13% of infected cases. Absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and Mayaro fevers. Younger children with WEE are more severely affected neurologically and fatally. About 30% of infants develop serious neurologic sequelae. The overall CFR for WEE is 3–7%.
Early Lyme disease is generally treated for 10–14 days, late Lyme disease for 21–30 days. Oral antibiotics commonly used are: doxycycline or amoxicillin. Patients with neurological or cardiac forms of illness may need iv ceftriaxone or penicillin.
There is strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence for a causal relation between vCJD and the BSE agent. In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period. The behavior of the vCJD agent under laboratory conditions is also very like that of BSE. There is a strong host genetic component, with certain variants of the prion protein gene being much more susceptible to vCJD
Person-to-person transmission via fecal–oral route (hands, food, water, sexual contact).
1–7 days; up to 60 days in case of low inhaled dose.
Ixodid wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni).
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America. The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). In that time period in the USA, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas. Most US cases occur in the late summer, when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir. In warm climates year-round transmission is seen.
Sudden onset of high fever, headache, chills, vomiting, myalgias, photophobia and dysthesias; 50–90% of apparent cases develop encephalitis. In the USA, one-third of encephalitis cases die and one-third of the survivors are moderately to severely disabled.
Amphotericin B is recommended for severe cases. Itraconazole for milder cases.
Culture is the gold standard but is insensitive. PCR is more sensitive than culture. Serology may be helpful in patients presenting 3 weeks or more after cough onset, when both culture and PCR are likely to be negative.
Demonstration of Strongyloides larvae on repeated stool specimens by microscopy after concentration (coproculture or Baermann). Stool examination has poor sensitivity, particularly in chronic cases. Serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, and perform better in chronic cases and are therefore used for screening patients at risk for hyperinfection. PCR has higher sensitivity than microscopy. Hyperinfection: larvae or parasite DNA can be found in sputum and other specimens.
Humans, generally children with inapparent infections.
Snail–human–snail. Infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans with water contact. Cercariae enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver, where they grow into adult male and female worms that migrate to the abdominal veins, mate, and produce eggs. Snails are infectious for up to 3 months, humans for 10 years or more.
4–28 days (median 8 days).
Historically, dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with an incidence of 3.5 million cases per year (1986). An international control effort reduced that to just over 1,785 cases detected in five African countries by 2010: Mali, Ghana, South Sudan, Chad, and Ethiopia. Nearly 95% of the cases are reported from South Sudan. Additionally, Niger reported 3 imported cases from Mali. Chad did not report cases for more than 10 years when an outbreak occurred with 10 cases in 2010. In Mali and Southern Sudan, violence has interfered with the eradication campaign, but Ghana and Ethiopia are close to eradication. Ghana diagnosed their last indigenous case in May 2010. Dracunculiasis mainly affects poor communities without a safe portable water supply and is mainly limited to remote nomadic communities. There is a marked increase in infection in the dry season when stagnant pools are the only source of water. Most cases are young (working) adults who may be exposed to contaminated water sources more frequently. There is no particular age or sex predilection. Countries free of transmission neighboring endemic countries should remain alert for imported cases and take adequate preventive measures.
Boutonneuse fever (group name for R.conorii infections: MSF, ISF, ITT), QTT and STT/NATT: mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks, eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy (in ISF, eschars are rare), generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4–5 days. The disease can be severe with a CFR up to 3%. ATBF is milder than other rickettsioses, fever and rash are less common, multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy.
RT-PCR on whole blood or serum; virus isolation; plaque reduction neutralization test (there is crossreactivity with related viruses, including CHIKV).
Fleas, especially the rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) and possibly human flea (Pulex irritans).
None.
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano. Also by inoculation and organ transplantation.
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode lungworm of rats. Adult worms are 17 to 25 mm long. Angiostrongylus costaricensis is the causal agent of abdominal, or intestinal, angiostrongyliasis and is not shown on the map. Other pathogens, like Gnathostoma spinigerum, are able to cause eosinophilic meningitis, but are not shown on the map.
The 17D live, attenuated vaccine is protective after 10 days; revaccination is recommended every 10 years. Anti-mosquito precautions. Prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle.
Hard ticks, with Ixodes ricinus as the most important vector of the European subtype and I. persulcatus for the other subtypes.
Minute hard ticks: Ixodes ricinus in Eurasia, possibly Hemaphysalis longicornisin Korea, I. ovatusin Japan. I. scapularis (formerly I. dammini) in eastern North America, possibly I. dentatus in the central USA, I. pacificus in California and Washington state, USA.

ICD-9 056; ICD-10 B06
HIV is transmitted through contact with HIVinfected body fluids (blood, semen, and vaginal secretions) and is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection. Other routes are: sharing contaminated needles; mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding; blood or blood product transfusion; and organ or tissue transplantation.
Prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. Lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. Treat close contacts. There has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofWHO and with material support from UNICEF in the 1950s and 1960s.
Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world wide and is generally a disease of poor rural communities. These communities are often in hot and dry regions. It is estimated that there are about 41 million people with active trachoma and 8 million with trichiasis. Highest prevalences are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a high burden in Ethiopia and Sudan, where active trachoma in some communities can be found in > 50% of 1–9-year-old children and trichiasis in > 19% of adults. In Asia and Central and South America, the distribution ismore focal. Overall the incidence of trachoma is declining and the disease has disappeared from Europe and North America due to improved living conditions.
ICD-9 066.3; ICD-10 A92.8
Tick-borne Encephalitis
3 to 4 months, but is highly variable.
Microscopy of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, tissue or exudate in which detection of spherules containing endospores is diagnostic (double-walled structures, size 20–100 mm) fungal culture of sputum, blood, pus, and urine; coccidioidal serologic tests; cocciodin or spherulin skin test (not available in USA). Serology on CSF to diagnose meningitis.
Listeriasis, listerellosis.
Person-to-person transmission occurs parentally (blood to blood). Mother to child transmission or transmission via sexual contact is rare. Mother to child transmission increases if the mother is co-infected with HIV.
By mosquito bite. Airborne transmission has been reported among laboratory personnel.
Avoid ingesting raw freshwater fish. Adequate cooking, freezing at 20 C for at least 7 days, or irradiation of fish or meat will kill encysted larvae. Sanitation.
Similar to syphilis, the clinical manifestations can be classified into early and late stages. Early-stage lesions are generally infectious and may last up to 5 years, with periods of latency. The disease has a relapsing clinical course with mainly skin manifestations, which is the only finding in pinta. In yaws and endemic syphilis there is also involvement of the mucous membranes and the bones. Cardiovascular and neurological lesions are extremely rare.
Humans. Loa loa also infects some monkeys but the human and simian cycles seem to be independent.
California Group Virus Disease
ICD-9 088.81; ICD-10 A69.2
Microscopy for eggs in stool samples; quantification of eggs by Kato–Katz method; PCR.
Depends on disease severity and type of disease. In areas with high penicillin resistance, ceftriaxone can be used for severe disease. In case of ceftriaxone resistance, vancomycin is used. For meningitis, dexamethasone is added to antibiotic treatment.
C. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions. The organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months. Prevention is targeted to those working with livestock, mainly sheep and goats; appropriate disposal of birth products; routine testing of risk animals; restricted movement of animals in infected regions; culling of infected animals; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries; pasteurize milk.
Rubella specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples; RT-PCR or virus isolation from throat swab, or other specimens in CRS.
Individuals with trichiasis require eyelid surgery. Active disease requires antibiotics: azithromycin or tetracycline eye ointment are recommended. Treatment of individual cases has little impact, because of rapid reinfection. Community management using the SAFE strategy (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics to clear infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement [water and sanitation] to reduce transmission) is the recommended means for control in endemic areas; this strategy includes both treatment and prevention.
ICD-9 083.8; ICD-10 A77.4

HCV infection has a worldwide prevalence of 2% and an estimated 130 to 170 million chronic cases globally. The highest prevalences are found in Africa and Asia. Egypt has the highest HCV prevalence rate (22%), likely due to a national schistosomiasis treatment campaign since the 1960s that re-used needles. In developing countries the high prevalence is likely due to poor infection control practices in the healthcare system (therapeutic injections, blood transfusion, surgery). Also local practices in the community, like acupuncture and cutting of the skin with unsterile knives, are other important routes of transmission. In Asia it is common to receive injections for various illnesses outside the hospital setting. In developed countries HCV is mainly transmitted by IVDU, accounting for 70–80% of HCV infections.
Most cases occur within 14 days (range: 1 day to months). Shorter incubation periods are associated with more heavily contaminated wounds and an inoculation site closer to the central nervous system. Neonatal tetanus has a shorter incubation period, with an average of around 6 days.
By animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch (rarely). Infected livestock do not bite typically, but may infect a person through their saliva. Very rare: licks upon mucosal surfaces; aerosols in bat-infested caves; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation. Rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species, for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed.
Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. Complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
Drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. There is an up to 10% relapse rate.
Rats (Rattus, particularly R. norvegicus and Bandicotta spp.). Infected dogs, wild mammals, and marsupials have been found, but do not contribute to the spread of the disease.
ICD-9 022; ICD-10 A22
Human.
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (L3) that can penetrate the skin. After entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). After mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis
Anti-mosquito measures: light-colored clothing with long sleeves mosquito repellents containing DEET on exposed skin, avoid as much as possible outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active, and removal of mosquito-breeding sites from around the home.
ICD-9 071; ICD-10 A82
The vector becomes infected with OROV by feeding on a viremic host. The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect. After a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding. Jungle cycle: OROV is transmitted among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Urban cycle: OROV is transmitted to humans by midges (Culicoides paraensis).
Two licensed oral live attenuated rotavirus vaccines are available. Surveillance is needed to collect data on the burden of rotaviral disease and the circulating strains to assess the potential impact of vaccine introduction. Virus is shedded before and until 1 week after onset of illness and can survive for a prolonged period of time on hard surfaces, hands, and in water. Improved sanitation, access to clean water, and hygiene have not yet shown to reduce rotavirus disease incidence.
In 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new S. Typhi cases and 216,500 deaths, with large regional variability. These estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease. Typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in South Central and Southeast Asia and South Africa. Two seasonality patterns are observed: (1) higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water, and (2) higher incidence in the rainy season, due to spillover from sewage to drinking water. Declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved, mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation (see Water and Sanitation map).
2–3 months.
Smallpox vaccine is protective, but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic. Hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions.
Sanitation to avoid contamination of vector snail habitat with human or animal feces. Improve water drainage, use molluscicides and avoid eating uncooked aquatic plants in endemic areas and drinking untreated water.
None.
MPV is endemic in heavily forested areas of Africa, primarily of low altitude and high humidity. The outlier in shrub country in the Sudan is anomalous ecologically and might have been initiated by an infected traveler from the Congo Basin region. Males and females are equally affected, children under 15 more than adults. Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006–2007 (14.5 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs (native ground squirrels) either at a child-care center or from pet stores. The animals had been exposed to imported, infected West African rodents on the premises of a distributor of exotic pets. There were more than 70 cases but no fatalities.
None.
Characterized by high fever of 2–7 days alternating with afebrile periods of 4–14 days, relapsing up to 13 times. Initial symptoms include generalized body aches, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, chills, sweats, and a transitory rash. Later symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dry cough, photophobia, neck pain, conjunctivitis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, confusion; rarely hematuria and epistaxis. Long-term sequelae of TBRF include cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities, ophthalmia and abortion. LBRF is generally more severe than TBRF, but associated with fewer relapses.
Mebendazole or albendazole with adjunctive corticosteroids. Lumbar puncture relieves the headache. Ocular infection requires surgery.
Mainly rodents and other sylvatic mammals. Canines are a reservoir for L. infantum/chagasi and possible reservoir for L. (Viannia) spp.
Standard anti-mosquito and anti-malarial precautions. There is no vaccine.
Mosquitoes (Aedes and Culex spp.).
Echinococcus multilocularis, a small (3–6 mm long) cyclophyllid cestode (tapeworm).
Headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. In the later stage of the disease, the metacestode may grow into neighboring organs (e.g. through the diaphragm into the lungs), and metastases can form anywhere. The differential diagnosis is hepatic cirrhosis or carcinoma. The disease can be fatal.
Virus isolation from stool, CSF or oropharyngeal secretion, followed by typing (to determine if the virus is ‘wild type’ or a vaccine strain). Alternatively, the diagnosis can be established by serological testing.
Undetermined. Thought to be forest rodents (squirrels, rats, mice, dormice), shrews and monkeys in the rainforests of West and Central Africa.
West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus, with an envelope and RNA plus-strand genome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes has resulted in a division of WNV strains into four distinct lineages, with lineage 1 strains further separatedinto three clades (1a, 1b, and 1c). Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus are subtypes of WNV that are endemic in parts of Oceania.
The detection of virus by culture or PCR in characteristic skin lesions. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry also support the diagnosis. Laboratory testing should be performed in specialized laboratories.

Nipah virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including bat saliva (on fallen fruit and in date palm sap), or droplets from coughing infected pigs. In Bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission.
The detection of virus in saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, or seminal fluid by culture or RT-PCR. Detection of mumps specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples.
The virus can be transmitted from mother to child through breast-milk; also through sexual contact, contaminated blood products, organ transplants, and shared syringes during iv drug use.
Fecal–oral route, mainly exposure to food or water contaminated with infectious cysts. Direct human-to-human transmission occurs via oral and anal sexual activities.
4–10 days.
Gastric anisakidosis: findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed. Gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis. Intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, peritonitis, ulceration, and bleeding. Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis. Pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom.
Wading birds (Ardeidae) and domestic pigs which amplify the virus asymptomatically; mosquitoes by transovarial transmission and possibly overwintering adults.
ICD-125.2; ICD-10 B74.3
Varies from a few days to just over a week, depending on infectious dose.
Soil, decaying vegetation.
Cholera is a common cause of epidemic diarrhea throughout the developing world. There are an estimated 3 to 5million cholera cases and 100,000 to 130,000 deaths due to cholera each year. The disease is endemic on the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It has a seasonal pattern with one or two peaks corresponding to the warm season. Areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation such as slums, refugee camps, and regions with political conflicts are at high risk for cholera outbreaks. Natural disasters (e.g. flooding) can be followed by cholera outbreaks due to disruption of the sanitation system (see Natural Disasters map). In 2010, a severe cholera epidemic was introduced into Haiti by human activity from a distant geographic source. Cholera was absent from Haiti for at least 100 years. Cases have also been detected in Florida and the Dominican Republic. Current-circulating V. cholerae strains are of the O1 and O139 serotype. Cholera caused by O1 strains of the El Tor biotype occurs world wide. The O1 classical biotype is confined to Bangladesh. In India, some recently isolated strains display characteristics of both the classical and El Tor biotype. Since 1992, the O139 serotype has caused cholera in Bangladesh and India. Other serotypes of toxin-producing Vibrio cholerae (e.g. O141 and O75) have caused severe diarrhea in patients who consumed seafood from the Gulf Coast of the USA.
Supportive.
Consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Median 19 days, range 15–24 days.
Infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. Onset is often insidious. Common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. Cough may be prominent. Symptoms can come and go. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. Bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. Anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
Humans are the main reservoir. S. haematobium can infect primates, livestock and rodents. S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, and S. guineensis can infect rodents.
For S. stercoralis: mainly humans, although infections in non-human primates and dogs have been described. S. fuelleborni is mainly found in in monkeys, but human-to-human transmission may occur in some geographical regions.
Dengue fever (DF): ICD-9 061, ICD-10 A90; Dengue hemorrhagic fever/Dengue shock syndrome (DHF/ DSS): Dengue fever (DF): ICD-9 061, ICD-10 A90; Dengue hemorrhagic fever/Dengue shock syndrome (DHF/

Chronic follicular conjunctivitis.
Female mosquito of the genus Anopheles (see Anopheles map).
Praziquantel is recommended; alternative: oxamniquine for S. mansoni, metrifonate for S. haematobium.
5 to 12 days for conjunctivitis; years to decades for trichiasis and eventually corneal damage and blindness. Repeated re-infection over many years is required for deposition of sufficient conjunctival scar to lead to the blinding complications; host genetic factors are probably also important.
Mosquito (Anopheles spp.), mainly bites between dusk and dawn (see Anopheles map).
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens, stool or blood by RT-PCR; virus isolation; serology by IFA or ELISA. Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures (BSL-3).
Supportive; vitamin A supplementation is important to avoid the complications of vitamin A deficiency resulting from the infection. Efficacy of ribavirin is unproven.
Hard ticks, principally Hyalomma spp., also Boophilus spp. and Rhipicephalus spp.
Snails, slugs, and land planarians. The giant African snail, Achatina fulica, is the major source of infection world wide; but has been replaced by the imported South American golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, in Taiwan and mainland China.
Guinea worm disease, Medina worm disease, Pharaoh worm disease, serpent worm disease, dracontiasis.
The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host. The virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito. After several days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
By bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly.
For W. bancrofti: Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles spp., and Aedes spp. in the Pacific Islands; for B. malayi: Mansonia, Anopheles, and Aedes; for B. timori, An. barbirostris. Anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than Culex spp., and Culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.

Bird flu, avian influenza, highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1.
Long-tailed and pigtailed macaques, and banded leaf monkeys. P. knowlesi can also infect other primates, including New World marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), African olive baboons (Papio anubis), Old World macaques, and humans by blood passage and mosquito bites.
Small rodents (mice, voles, rats) and insectivores (shrews, hedgehogs) are the most common animal reservoirs of Borrelia, while larger animals (deer, livestock) serve as hosts for the tick vectors. Hares and birds may also serve as reservoirs. Ticks by trans-stadial transmission; transovarial transmission in ticks is limited.
Ehrlichiosis occurs worldwide, principally following the distribution of the transmitting tick vectors and reservoir species. Less is known of the epidemiology and ecology of E. chaffeensis as compared to A. phagocytophilum. Most HME cases are reported in the south-central and eastern USA, where A. americanum reaches high population densities. Approximately 70% of HME cases occur from May to July in the USA, corresponding to the peak feeding activity period of the ticks. HME is most commonly diagnosed in adults, with a male-to-female ratio of > 2:1. Most HME cases are single and not clustered. Recreational or occupational activities in rural tick-infested habitats are at risk. Majority of the cases have a history of a tick bite. Ehrlichiosis is often not recognized in Africa, where the primary diagnostic focus is malaria and typhoid fever. Sennetsu fever occurs in Asian regions where the eating of raw fish is common, such as in Japan. N. sennetsu has been detected in the climbing perch in Laos, a fish common throughout the Mekong River, Basin. Climbing perch is widely distributed and eaten in Asia.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis
Lice infestation (pediculosis) can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling (bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation). The body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding. Oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people.
<1–19 days, average about 3–4 days, depending on the infecting dose. Viremia in humans may last for 4 months or more.
Early iv or im antibiotic therapy: iv benzylpenicillin, third-generation cephalosporin or chloramphenicol.
ICD-9 037, 771.3; ICD-10 A33–35
Inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated from infected animal body fluids (placenta, urine, milk, feces) or dust contaminated with dried animal excretions. Less common routes are enterally when consuming contaminated food products and possibly through skin inoculation. Personto-person transmission is rare.
Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages. Type A is highly virulent and divided into two clades: Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages.
ICD-9 076.1; ICD-10 A71
It takes 2 months (range: 5–12 weeks) to mature to an adult worm in the intestine. The incubation period of neurocysticercosis (time from infection to first symptom) is extremely variable from months to several years.
Serology (HEV IgM, IgG); HEV RNA detection in blood and stool by RT-PCR.
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in NewWorld cases. Symptoms are fever, myalgia, and GI pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock. Convalescence is prolonged. CFR is 35–60%.
Mainly a clinical diagnosis: subacute eosinophilic meningitis in an endemic area. Most common test is serology, but there are often false-positives due to cross-reactivity with other parasites. Worms are rarely seen in CSF by microscopy. MRI or CT scan of the brain is not diagnostic.
Infection control hospitals; safe injection practices by healthcare providers; screening of blood products; clean needle programs. HCV immunoglobulin is not effective. There is no vaccine.
Direct person-to-person transmission, usually following close contact with a symptomatic case or the respiratory secretions or body fluids of a symptomatic case. Healthcare facilities were key in amplifying the transmission of SARS in 2003. Respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces are thought to be the principal routes of transmission, although one outbreak in a residential block in Hong Kong was attributed to aerosol spread.
ICD-9 006; ICD-10 A06
Blood or bone marrow culture and other infected bodily tissues (urine, CSF); serology; PCR.

In the USA, an average of only 6 neuroinvasive cases of EEE are reported annually. The annual number of cases has declined in recent years. Incidence is similar among different age groups and ethnicities, but it is twice as high among men. Persons aged over 50 and under 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease. In North America, outbreaks occur during the mosquito season. In tropical South America transmission to horses is year-round, but human cases are rare. Culiseta breeds in swampy areas in woodland, transmitting the virus from marsh-nesting birds to horses kept in such areas; unvaccinated horses often die. Outbreaks in Mexico and islands of the Caribbean have all been due to the North American subtype, indicating spread by migratory birds. South American strains are distinct and of three different lineages, probably determined by the range of different rodent hosts. Only a single human case has been reported from Brazil, and none from Guatemala, Belize, Colombia, Ecuador Peru, Cuba, or Trinidad and Tobago in spite of detection of the virus in mosquitoes or horses in those countries. The virus has also been isolated from horses in eastern Canada.
Common in tropical and subtropical areas world wide among people who go barefoot, endemic between 30 N and 15 S of the equator. Mycetoma is endemic in areas with a short rainy season of relatively low rainfall and a temperature range of 30–37 C, followed by a long dry season with low relative humidity temperatures ranging from a night-time low of as little as 15 C to a daytime maximum of up to 60 C. This extreme alteration in weather conditions might be necessary to the survival of the causative organism in its natural niche in soil or plant material. Cases have been exported from the endemic region to many nonendemic countries. World wide, about 60% of cases are caused by actinomycetes; the rest are caused by fungi. In Africa, eumycetomas are more frequently observed than actinomycetomas; in India, actinomycetes are found in more than half of the cases reported. In South America, 90% of the cases are caused by actinomycetes. Infection is most often seen in herdsmen, farmers, and other field laborers. Males are 4–5 times more often affected than females, even in areas where both sexes spend a lot of time in the fields. Mycetoma is seen in all age groups, but usuallyin adults 20–40 years old. The disease progresses faster in HIVpositive and other immunocompromised patients.
Lockjaw.
Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive rod-shaped intracellular bacterium. There are at least 13 serotypes, with serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b causing most disease. L. ivanovii is a very rare enteric opportunistic human pathogen.
Falciparum malaria, malaria tropica, tropical fever, blackwater fever, paludism, marsh fever.
1–21 days for most acute cases but activation of latent infection has occurred from 25 to 63 years after exposure.
malaria, paludism, tropical fever.
Isolation and barrier nursing of cases; discourage butchering of wildlife that died from unknown causes and burial practices of cases involving ritual embalming. Avoid bat-infested caves or mines in endemic areas.
Freshwater snails: Oncomelania spp. for S. japonicum, Robertsiella spp. for S. malayensis, Neotricula spp. for S. mekongi.
ICD-9 082; ICD-10 A77
Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous and Mucosal, Old World
Rat Bite Fever
The tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. As the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
ONNV is transmitted by the African malaria vectors Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae, and probably other members of the complex.
Coccidioidomycosis
Virus detection in the blood by RT-PCR or virus isolation; IgM ELISA is available, cross-reactivity may occur with other flaviviruses.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; treatment of infected humans.
There are an estimated 1,000–3,000 human cases per year, but there is considerable underreporting and underdiagnosis. The last plague pandemic of 1894 started in Hong Kong establishing many endemic foci world wide. New foci continue to arise, as was seen in Algiers, in 2003. Warm springs and wet summers have increased the plague prevalence in the great gerbil in Kazakhstan. Similar climatic conditions may have resulted in past plague pandemics. Infection control and antibiotics can decrease plague morbidity and mortality but plague cannot be eradicated as it is widespread in wild rodents. There has been a large shift in case load from Asia to Africa, with more than 90% of cases occurring in Africa. The most common form is bubonic plague, but outbreaks of pneumonic plague still occur. Plague is possibly more common in Africa as poor rural communities in Africa live in close proximity to rodents, which are widely hunted and eaten in plague-endemic areas.
Chikungunya Fever
Hard ticks, principally Ixodes scapularis (formerly I. dammini) and I. pacificus in North America, I. persulcatus and I. ricinus in Eurasia. In Russia, the principal vectors are I. persulcatus in the west and I. ricinus in the east.
ICD-9 030; ICD-10 A30
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. The Montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
Community management by SAFE strategy (see above). The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma (GET 2020) seeks to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Deworming with mebendazole or albendazole; repeat treatment in case eggs are still detected in feces. Iron supplementation to correct anemia.
Globally, there exist four patterns of HAV infection, based on age-specific HAV seroprevalence rates. High-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children, who are usually asymptomatic. Adults are immune and epidemics in these high-endemic areas are uncommon. High-endemic areas is defined as a region where > 90% of the children <10 years are already infected and most cases are asymptomatic. The high endemic areas are generally in poor regions with poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water (see Human Development Index map and Sanitation map). Improving living conditions leads to intermediate endemicity, which causes high disease rates because more infections now occur in older people (as disease averted in children), who are symptomatic. HAV epidemiology in high-endemic areas is shifting to intermediate endemicity, which results in an increase in disease burden. Large variations exist within countries in HAV incidence. In (very) low-endemic areas, children will not acquire the disease and the adult population will remain susceptible, leading to localized outbreaks. In areas of low endemicity, the overall prevalence is <25%. In developed countries with low endemicity, outbreaks are often caused by contaminated food products, like shellfish, which can concentrate virus, and other food products that are contaminated by an infected food handler.
At least 2 weeks.
Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease
Personal anti-tick precautions (appropriate clothing, acaricide, repellent). Vaccine production ceased in the 1970s and there is no possibility of vector control due to the habitat. Screening of bone marrow donors in endemic areas.
Congo fever, Congo–Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Central Asian hemorrhagic fever
Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. An inactivated vaccine is available. Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
Hendra and Nipah Virus
Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease that can affect the skin, heart, nervous system and, less commonly, the eyes, kidneys, and liver. Often there is an annular skin rash that develops at the bite site, known as EM. After several months, approximately 60% of patients with untreated infection will have intermittent arthritis. Up to 5% of untreated patients develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection. Re-infection can occur.
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae.
Malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi
None.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an enveloped singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus. YFV is genetically more heterogeneous in Africa than in America, suggesting it originated in Africa.
Each virus is associated with either one or a few closely related species of rodents, which constitute the virus’s natural reservoir. Tacaribe complex viruses in the New World are generally associated with rats and mice (family Muridae, subfamily Sigmodontinae). The reservoir rodents are chronically infected, and the virus is transmitted among them, leading to lifelong viremia and virus excretion, and they do not die. The reservoir for Junin virus is Calomys musculinus and C. laucha, for Machupo virus, C. callosus, for Guanarito virus Zygodontomys brevicauda, and for Whitewater Arroyo virus Neotoma albigula. For Sabia and Chapare viruses the reservoir host is unknown.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
SARS
Ivermectin; alternative: albendazole or thiabendazole.
For C. philippinensis: eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds; after ingestion by freshwater fish, larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues. Ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host. The adults of C. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine, where the females lay eggs. Released larvae can cause autoinfection, which may progress to hyperinfection.
SARS presents initially with fever, headache, myalgia, and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early SARS illness. Case fatality is around 10%, and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults.
ICD-9 84.4; IDC-10 B53.1
None. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination.
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution. Livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
Lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). Infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
Diphyllobothriosis, Dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
Clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. Metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection. Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. Tetanus does not induce immunity. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
OROV was first isolated in Trinidiad in 1955. In South America, cases are limited to Trinidad, Panama, and the Amazon basin. Oropouche fever is, after dengue fever, the most common arboviral infection in Brazil. The virus has periodically caused large urban epidemics in Brazil and Peru, during which up to 60% of the population has been affected. There also outbreaks in villages and sporadic cases. Approximately 500,000 cases have occurred in Brazil since the 1960s. There are three OROV genotypes circulating in Brazil: genotypes I and II in the Amazon Basin and genotype III in the Southeast Region. Genotype III has been isolated from a marmoset (Callithrix species) in southeastern Brazil, and also occurs in Panama. Outbreaks coincide with periods of highest rainfall, when biting midge density is greatest. OROV infections are likely underdiagnosed in South America as was seen during a concurrent outbreak of dengue virus and OROV in Manus (Brazil), where OROV infections were missed by physicians and the Public Health Authority.
3 to 5 years (range 9months to > 20 years); shorter for PL than for ML.
O. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. Occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. O. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). Chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.
By bite of the female sandfly (usually at dusk and at sundown, often indoors); rarely by blood transfusion or transplacental. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and fever can develop when the worms move through the lungs. In about 5 to 14 days the larvae reach the central nervous system, leading to subacute meningitis. Eosinophilic meningitisis defined asmeningitiswith > 10 eosinophils/mL in CSF or at least 10% eosinophils in the total CSF leukocyte count. Some caseshavelow-grade fever and temporary facial paralysis. Signs of raised intracranial pressure, like diplopia. Worms occasionallyenter theeye.Thecourse of theillnessranges from a fewdays to several months. Death is rare.
Hepatitis E
Opisthorchiasis
No specific treatment is available.
For C. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
None.
3–6 months for B. malayi worms to mature and produce microfilariae that appear in the blood; 6–12 months for W. bancrofti and B. timori.
Not completely understood; most Bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals (mainly wild rodents) as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes. African rodents replicate BUNV and develop viremia. Livestock (goats, sheep, cattle), horses and rodents are hosts for GERV as shown by seroprevalence studies. Amplifying hosts for CVV are mainly large mammals (caribou, deer, horses, sheep).
Food-borne and transplacental (mother to child). Ingestion of L. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide. Development of the disease depends on the host immunity.
3–12 days.
Varies from weeks to several months, depending on infection intensity.
Unclear. Bamboo rats (Rhizomys sinensis, R. pruinosus, R. sumatrensis, and Cannomys badius) are natural hosts and the fungus is detected in the soil of their burrows. P. marneffei can survive in sterile soil for several weeks and only a few days in non-sterile soil. P. marneffei has not been recovered from environments not associated with bamboo rats. Bamboo rats (except C. badius) eat principally bamboo.
Each hantavirus has its specific rodent host. HPS is generally caused by the sigmodontine-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that hantaviruses have a long co-evolutionary history with their host.
3 to 17 days; average 10 days.
Praziquantel and triclabendazole. Bithionol is an alternative treatment but has more side effects. In cerebral paragonimiasis, steroids are added.
Loiasis
Classical pertussis has a prodromal stage of 1–2 weeks with coryza and a mild, persistent cough that progresses to paroxysms of violent coughing interspersed with an inspiratory whoop. Vomiting may follow coughing bouts. This stage can last 4–6 weeks. Adolescents and adults often do not have paroxysms and whooping, presenting more commonly with a prolonged cough. Asymptomatic infection may also occur. Infants under 6 months may present with apnea, and deaths occur mostly in this age group. Serious complications include pneumonia, seizures, cerebral hypoxia, and encephalopathy.
Human–sandfly–human. Humans can be bacteremic for many months. Period of infectivity in the sandfly is unknown.
Rotaviral Enteritis
Dry, sandy alkaline soil in the semi-arid zones of the USA–Mexico border and parts of Central and South America. In North America, the fungus is mainly found in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone with low rainfall and high temperatures C. immitis is present in California, and probably northern Mexico and Arizona, and C. posadasii is present in the remaining areas.
20–30 years.
1 to 3 days.
Bunyamwera encephalitis, Bunyamwera viral disease, Cache Valley encephalitis.
Supportive care; ribavirin iv is effective if given within the first 6 days after infection. There is no vaccine.
The principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity. Three clinical forms are recognized. The commonest is generalized tetanus, which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern. On presentation patients commonly have ‘lockjaw’ (trismus), neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal rigidity. Generalized spasms may result in an arched posture (opisthotonus). Other symptoms include elevated temperature, blood pressure, and sweating. Localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound. Cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck, and affects cranial nerves.
Vivax malaria; recurring malaria; tertian malaria; paludism; marsh fever; ague.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Inoculation of equids with live, attenuated TC-83 VEE vaccine blocks amplification; this vaccine is available to laboratory personnel but not to the public. VEE isinfectious if airborne and can cause infections in laboratory staff.
There is a natural cycle between ticks and animals with humans as accidental host.
7 to 15 days, but can be longer.
A self-limiting disease that lasts for about 4 to 7 days. Patients usually experience dengue-like illness with fever, muscle pain, headache, and joint pain. The disease may progress in some cases to one or more of three distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5–2% of patients) with retinitis and possible blindness; meningoencephalitis (about 1%), patients usually recover; or acute hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever (about 1%) with a CFR of 50%. Some patients are misdiagnosed as meningitis.
HME, HGA: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. Leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. HME cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. Sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. Reinfection can occur. CFR is 2.7% for HME, <1% for HGA, and absent for E. ewingii infection.
Access to clean water and sanitation; protective clothing for occupational risk; after accidental exposure, dry the skin and apply 70% alcohol; mollusciciding; avoid contact with contaminated water bodies.
After ingestion, the virus infects hepatocytes, resulting in periportal necrosis. The virus is shed via bile into the stool and contaminates the environment, leading to new infections in susceptible exposed individuals.
Supportive treatment; ribavirin. Junin convalescent serum reduces the CFR of Argentinian hemorrhagic fever to <1%.
Main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
Zika virus fever.
2–14 days (usually 5–7).
Median 12.5 days, range 1–3 weeks.
Infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds (dust storms) after heavy rains that advance mold growth, usually late summer or early fall. It is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the USA. Incidence in California and Arizona appears to have increased since 1991 and again since 2001, probably driven by immigration of non-immunes andwheather conditions that favor dissemination of the fungus. Prevalence of infection in northern Mexico is reported to be 10–40%. Male gender, African-American and Filipino race/ethnicity, immunosuppression, diabetes, older age and pregnancy are risk factors for chronic and disseminated disease. Infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported.
Ehrlichioses
Human–mosquito–human around housing; monkey–mosquito–monkey and monkey–mosquito–human in the forests of West Africa and Malaysia. Human viremia lasts 3–5 days since onset of symptoms; the mosquito can transmit 8–12 days after taking a viremic blood meal, depending on the ambient temperature.
HFRS is caused by Myodes-, Rattus-, and Apodemusborne hantaviruses. Each virus has its particular host: Apodemus spp. (striped field mouse) for HTNV, DOBV and SAAV and Myodes ( Clethrionomys) for PUUV. SEOV infects Rattus norvegicus and can therefore be found world wide.
Hepatitis B
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA) or by detection of OROV RNA in blood by RT-PCR.
ICD-9 120; ICD-10 B65
Bird–mosquito–bird, with accidental dead-end infections in humans, equines, and other vertebrate animals.
Serology to detect specific IgM antibodies; RT-PCR to detect viral RNA in blood or stool.
