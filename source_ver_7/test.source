control deer population; avoid areas with ticks; tick bite precautions: cover skin, repellent on skin and clothing (permethrin, deet), check daily for attached ticks and remove.
tetanus spores enter the body through wounds and under anaerobic conditions, the spores germinate and produce toxin. the toxins are disseminated via the blood and lymphatic system and bind to nerve endings, preventing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. this results in unopposed skeletal muscle contraction.
in 2000, who started the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis that aims to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity. endemic areas are mapped with subsequent mass treatment for the population at-risk (see therapy) for 5 years. care needs to be taken in loiasis endemic areas to prevent adverse events (see loiasis map); vector control (e.g. bed nets, repellent).
small wild mammals such as rodents, snowshoe hares, deer and vector mosquitoes (venereal and transovarian transmission occur). dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of lacv, as the main vector (aedes triseriatus) only bites in daytime. for this reason, nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with lacv. the white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for jcv (horses can also be an amplifying host). snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of sshv.
primarily old world fruit-eating bats, mainly in the family pteropodidae.
ixodid wood tick (dermacentor andersoni).
snail–human–snail. infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). the cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water, enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver. when matured to adult male and female worms, they migrate to the abdominal veins (s. mansoni, s. intercalatum, s. guineensis) or pelvic veins (s. haematobium), mate and produce eggs. snails remain infectious for up to 3 months, humans for more than 10 years.
none.
hme, hga: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. hme cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. reinfection can occur. cfr is 2.7% for hme, <1% for hga, and absent for e. ewingii infection.
the disease ecology is not completely understood. humans are likely dead end hosts.
domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.urinary carriagemay occur in areas where schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. there is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
humans, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, water buffalo and wild rodents for s. japonicum, rodents for s. malayensis, pigs and dogs for s. mekongi.
since the global polio eradication initiative, cases have decreased significantly. there were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries afghanistan, india, nigeria, and pakistan. in endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. in 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in tajikistan. most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in chad, angola, sudan, and the drc. this illustrates the difficulties of the global polio eradication program. risk is seasonal in the temperate climates, with highest risks during the warmer months.
flies can contaminate foods.
human-deer-fly-human. after infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. in the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. an infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
world wide, but the epidemiology of the meningococcal meningitis is regionally heterogeneous and dynamic. group a causes the highest incidence and is responsible for large epidemics every 5–10 years in a belt that stretches across the semi-arid regions of sub-saharan africa: world wide, but the epidemiology of the meningococcal meningitis is regionally heterogeneous and dynamic. group a causes the highest incidence and is responsible for large epidemics every 5–10 years in a belt that stretches across the semi-arid regions of sub-saharan
this is unknown at present. m. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. in australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry m. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
in africa, isolated from aedes africanus, ae. apicoargenteus, ae. luteocephalus, ae. aegypti, ae. vittatus, and ae. furcifer mosquitoes; probably ae. hensilii on yap island.
for bacteria, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, long-acting sulfonamides; for fungi, itraconazole, ketaconazole, or voriconazole. resection of small lesions; advanced lesions may require amputation of the hand or leg.
surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye. diethylcarbamazine (dec) is filaricidal but can cause saes in patients with heavy infection. saes can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids. alternative: albendazole with a lower risk of saes in case of heavy infection.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. treat close contacts. there has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofwho and with material support from unicef in the 1950s and 1960s.
lpai viruses naturally circulate in wild birds, principally waterfowl and gulls, in which they generally cause no symptoms. lpai viruses are transmitted to terrestrial poultry (chickens, turkeys). lpai most likely evolved to hpai in aquatic birds (ducks and geese). transmission of hpai into migratory birds can result in large die-offs.
penicillium marneffei, a dimorphic fungus. it is the only penicillium species that is dimorphic: at body temperature or 37 c it is a yeast form and at cooler temperature it grows as a mold.
inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated from infected animal body fluids (placenta, urine, milk, feces) or dust contaminated with dried animal excretions. less common routes are enterally when consuming contaminated food products and possibly through skin inoculation. personto-person transmission is rare.
treatment of uncomplicated b. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. in case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. heart valve replacement may be needed.
chronic, painless skin nodule that progresses to a severe,deforming ulcer. one-third of early nodules heal spontaneously. most nodules appear on limbs, but also face and breast; skin lesions may also appear as plaques or indurated edematous lesions; osteomyelitis. typical characteristic is the presence of deeply undermined ulcers. sequelae include contracture, deformity, and permanent disability.
for c. philippinensis: eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds; after ingestion by freshwater fish, larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues. ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host. the adults of c. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine, where the females lay eggs. released larvae can cause autoinfection, which may progress to hyperinfection.
tetracycline, doxyxyline. alternative: chloramphenicol.
classically meningococcal meningitis presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. in infants and young children the clinical picture may be non-specific. if the patient also has meningococcal bacteremia, a hemorrhagic skin rash may be seen.
many species of mosquitoes of the genera aedes, mansonia, culex, and anopheles.
for s. stercoralis: mainly humans, although infections in non-human primates and dogs have been described. s. fuelleborni is mainly found in in monkeys, but human-to-human transmission may occur in some geographical regions.
treponema pallidum ssp. endemicum (bejel), t. pallidum ssp. pertenue (yaws), and t. carateum (pinta), spirochetes that are morphologically and serologically similar to t. pallidum ssp. pallidum, the agent of syphilis.
the global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus, and occurs basically between the 10 c isotherms. autochthonous dengue fever cases appeared in europe for the first time in 2010, north of 10 c isotherm and likely transmitted by ae. albopictus (see aedes agypti and aedes albopictus map). there is strong seasonality, correlated with the rainy season, which produces a marked increase in vectors because more mosquito-breeding sites become available then. two, 3 or all 4 serotypes may occur concurrently. dhf/dss in many countries is most often seen in children suffering a secondary infection with a different serotype. incidence rates of up to 3% have been seen in dengue naõve populations such as are found in some pacific islands.
rabbit fever, deerfly fever, hare fever, lemming fever, ohara fever, francis disease.
classical pertussis has a prodromal stage of 1–2 weeks with coryza and a mild, persistent cough that progresses to paroxysms of violent coughing interspersed with an inspiratory whoop. vomiting may follow coughing bouts. this stage can last 4–6 weeks. adolescents and adults often do not have paroxysms and whooping, presenting more commonly with a prolonged cough. asymptomatic infection may also occur. infants under 6 months may present with apnea, and deaths occur mostly in this age group. serious complications include pneumonia, seizures, cerebral hypoxia, and encephalopathy.
thorough cleansing of wounds and postexposure prophylaxis (pep): rabies-immune globulin and a series of rabies vaccinations. vaccination of people at high risk (veterinarians, animal rescue personnel, laboratory staff, etc.), avoid contact with stray dogs or cats, sick or dead wildlife; vaccinate all dogs and cats; distribute baits containing oral vaccine in wildlife habitat; quarantine dogs arriving from infected countries. culling of stray dogs is ineffective; sterilization prevents replacement breeding.
occupational hygiene by the use of protective clothing and avoiding contaminated surface waters (difficult in case of flooding in developing countries). environmental control measures, like rodent and flood control, are difficult to implement. chemoprophylaxis for adventure travelers, military personnel who visit endemic areas, and after an accidental lab exposure.
tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations. humans and lizards are dead-end hosts.
clinical diagnosis of active disease by presence of follicles and papillae on the conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid. trichiasis and corneal opacity are also diagnosed clinically. presence or absence of infecting agent (by any method, including pcr) has poor correlation with presence or absence of disease or its severity; serology has no diagnostic value.
o. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. o. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.
microscopy of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, tissue or exudate in which detection of spherules containing endospores is diagnostic (double-walled structures, size 20–100 mm) fungal culture of sputum, blood, pus, and urine; coccidioidal serologic tests; cocciodin or spherulin skin test (not available in usa). serology on csf to diagnose meningitis.
demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; pcr tests have been developed for the different leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. the montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
wear impermeable gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs; cook wild game well; avoid drinking water from untreated sources; wear long-sleeved clothes and use repellent to protect against arthropod bites.
who (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in india and sub saharan africa. 90% of the infections are due to w. bancrofti. chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. about 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). asia and south america have lower bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than sub saharan africa (up to 37%) and pacific island (up to 48%) regions. within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. reciffe, brazil). in the americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. china has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. the vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
mainly skin contact with fecally contaminated soil, but oral transmission cannot be excluded.
lockjaw.
together with tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, penicilliosis is a common opportunistic infection in hiv patients in southeast asia. though we could not find a report from myanmar, it is expected to be present there. in northern thailand it causes 15% of the hiv-related diseases. before the hiv epidemic it was a rare disease in immunocompromised patients residing in endemic areas in asia. cases of penicilliosis have been described world wide, mainly in hiv patients with a travel history to endemic regions. a single case has been described from ghana where there was no clear travel history to southeast asia. the association between bamboo rats and human infection is unclear. there is an association between infection risk and doing agricultural work, suggesting that soil exposure is a risk factor. the disease has a seasonal pattern with more cases during the rainy season.
supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin g, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
bite of infective female sandfly. rare reports exist of non-vector transmission, including transmission by blood transfusion, sharing of syringes, venereal contact, and possibly transplacentally; potential transmission via organ transplantation.
the fungus grows as a mycelium in the environment and in human or animal tissue it converts into a budding yeast.
supportive, there is no specific treatment.
lagomorphs and rodents (ground squirrels) for f. tularensis (types a and b) in north america. aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in north america, hares and small rodents in northern eurasia, for f. holarctica (type b). the bacterium can persist in water.
virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or rt-pcr; serology (igm elisa, ifa). virus isolation should be done in a bsl-4 laboratory.
humans.
consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl. there is no person-to-person transmission.
often asymptomatic in healthy individuals. symptomatic cases: fever, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and jaundice, hemolytic anemia; severe cases: retinal infarctions, ecchymoses and petechiae, acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, dic, liver and renal failure, and splenic rupture, with a mortality rate of 5–9%, higher in immunocompromised patients. the differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria, lyme disease, or human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
supportive; ribavirin is effective if given within the first 6 days; dialysis if indicated.
microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. in humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
the natural reservoir is unclear. the fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (dasypus novemcinctus). the disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. as armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. by using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of p. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
mosquitoes (aedes and culex spp.).
supportive care; ribavirin iv is effective if given within the first 6 days after infection. there is no vaccine.
removal of breeding sites in any type of container that holds water (e.g. vase, tire). larviciding standing water, adulticiding with non-persistent insecticides. personal protection with suitable clothing, mosquito repellents, nets, and screens.
female phlebotomine sandflies (phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p.chadaudi, p. longipes, p. pedifer)
alveolar or multilocular echinococcosis.
argentinian (junin virus), bolivian (machupo virus), brazilian (sabia virus), and venezuelan (guanarito virus) hemorrhagic fevers.
sudden onset of fever lasting 2–7 days, sometimes biphasic, severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and a maculopapular rash (not easily seen on dark skin). most cases recover. minor occurrence of petechiae, epistaxis, or gingival bleeding may be seen. serious hemorrhagic manifestations, like a severe drop in blood platelets, indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf), that can progress to dengue shock syndrome (dss) and death. infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity, but little cross-immunity to other serotypes. cross-immunity may exacerbate, rather than diminish, disease severity when infected with a new serotype; dhf leading to dss can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype, but dhf/dss has also been reported in primary infections. cfr for dhf is up to 20%, for untreated dss up to 50%, and 1–2% if correctly treated.
self-limiting disease. sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. patients eventually recover completely.
brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. from infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
use closed footwear; thoroughly clean penetrating wounds in endemic areas.
hcv infection has a worldwide prevalence of 2% and an estimated 130 to 170 million chronic cases globally. the highest prevalences are found in africa and asia. egypt has the highest hcv prevalence rate (22%), likely due to a national schistosomiasis treatment campaign since the 1960s that re-used needles. in developing countries the high prevalence is likely due to poor infection control practices in the healthcare system (therapeutic injections, blood transfusion, surgery). also local practices in the community, like acupuncture and cutting of the skin with unsterile knives, are other important routes of transmission. in asia it is common to receive injections for various illnesses outside the hospital setting. in developed countries hcv is mainly transmitted by ivdu, accounting for 70–80% of hcv infections.
animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
plasmodium vivax, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the phylum apicomplexa.

monkeys, possibly rodents.
p. knowlesi transmission is restricted to the leucosphyrus group of anophelines, consisting of 20 species.
hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (l3) that can penetrate the skin. after entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. in the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). after mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
hepatitis a virus (hav), a single stranded rna virus, genus hepatovirus in the family picornaviridae.
infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. onset is often insidious. common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. cough may be prominent. symptoms can come and go. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. hiv-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
a combination of several arvs is recommended, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections, general measures to maintain nutrition and health, and treatment of specific infections or hiv-associated disorders.
blood or bone marrow culture and other infected bodily tissues (urine, csf); serology; pcr.
a large number of infective mosquito bites are necessary to establish infection.
strongyloides stercoralis, a minute nematode roundworm (up to2.2 mmlong). s.fuelleborni (not shown on the map) is a less common agent and can causehuman diseasein africa and papua new guinea (‘swollen belly syndrome’ in infants).
the cestode diphyllobothrium latum (fish or broad tapeworm), the largest human tapeworm (up to 25 meters long). in japan and eastern russia d. nihonkaiense is common. at least 13 other diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently.
bite of infected larval mites (chiggers). there is no direct person-to-person transmission.
since the virus has a jungle cycle, environmental insecticide spraying is not feasible; routine personal anti-mosquito measures are indicated.
wildlife–tick–wildlife. the tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. the virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
humans.
the principle vector is the human body louse (pediculus humanus corporis), which lives in clothes. b. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas.
serology (eia, recombinant immunoblot assay (riba)); rt-pcr on plasma; quanititative rt-pcr to monitor treatment; genotyping; liver biopsy for histology to assess disease stage and activity.
rotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded rna virus within the reoviridae family, is classified into 7 rotavirus groups (a–g) as determined by the antigenic properties of the vp6 capsid protein. group a is most common in human disease, with b and c to a lesser extent. subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes p and g, of the vp4 and vp7 outer capsid proteins, respectively. these proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy.

uruma fever.
lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing is supportive. elisa or ifa, confirmed by igm and igg western or striped blot test. pcr on blood, csf, urine and tissues, but is not standardized.
the disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. patients are classified as having either pl or ml. pl is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ml is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. skin lesions are often symmetric. involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.
in the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during world war ii. childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to who have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. the who has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. however, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former soviet union. since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in africa, the middle east, asia, and south america. without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of c. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. this has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
lfv was isolated from a missionary nurse living in lassa, nigeria, in 1969. it is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic lassa fever cases in west africa each year, with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000. lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions: the mano river region (guinea, sierra leone, liberia) in the west, and nigeria in the east. in the dry season, the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses, and in the rainy season, the rat forages in the surrounding fields. villages with lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah, where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm. lfv can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season. however, in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses.
who recommended regimen (directly observed treatment short-course or dots) is 2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin plus isoniazid. if resistance to rifampicin or isoniazid is suspected, treatment must continue with second-line drugs for at least 18 months. drug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr and xdr-tb) require special regimens. mdr-tb is defined as resistance to two main first-line tb drugs: isoniazid and rifampicin. xdr-tb (extensive drug resistant tb) is defined as mdr-tb with resistance to fluoroquinolones and one second-line injectable drug.
s. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children and adults. risk factors for severe disease are: older age ( > 65 years), diabetes, chronic disease (heart, lung, kidney, liver), alcoholism, cancer, hiv, non-functioning or absent spleen, and sickle cell disease. a global burden of disease study estimated that in 2000 about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occurred world wide, leading to about 826,000 deaths in children <5 years. the most common presentation of severe disease is pneumonia. the majority of deaths (95%) occurred in africa and asia. since 2000 the pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced, mostly in developed countries,while developing countries need themmost. in 2008, 24 high-income and two middle-income countries had pneumococcal vaccination in their program, accounting for less than 0.2% of childhood pneumococcal deaths in 2000. many deaths in low-income countries are due to poor healthcare infrastructure and inadequate treatment options. penicillin and chloramphenicol are still widely used to treat meningitis despite high resistance levels against these agents in some areas. vaccination and access to proper treatment are needed in africa and asia. interventions should be targeted on countries with large populations and moderate incidence, and countries with high incidence and mortality.
hendra virus and nipah virus are negative-stranded rna viruses, and comprise the henipavirus genus within the family paramyxoviridae. hendra virus was discovered in horses and stable staff in australia in 1994, nipah virus in pigs and pig farmers in the town nipah, malaysia, in 1999.
freshwater operculate snails (mainly parafossarulus sp. and bithynia sp.).
buruli ulcer is named after buruli county in uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. the disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. west africa is the most affected region. typical buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. in southern australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. it is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. world wide, mainly children are susceptible to buruli ulcer disease.
chikungunya means ‘that which bends up’ in makonde language, to describe the pain.
mycobacterium ulcerans, an acid-fast, slow-growing bacillus. there are at least four geographically distinct strains: african, american, asian, and australian. they all produce mycolactone, which destroys tissue and suppresses the immune system. variations in the structure of mycolactone may correlate with disease severity in different regions.

hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
microscopic examination of sputum for eggs (acid-fast staining destroys eggs), and examination of feces after using concentration techniques; elisa for serology.
rubeola, morbilli.
fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. they may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. chest xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria, or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers. direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases. people recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks. rarely from contaminated items. in the past, outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk.
there is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito. the mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites, which, after release, infect erythrocytes. the erythrocytic stages multiply around 10-fold every 48-hours. erythrocytes can release gametocytes which infect mosquitoes during a blood meal. in the mosquito, gametocytes develop into sporozoites.
cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis
ancylostomiasis, necatoriasis, uncinariasis, ground itch.
by arthropod bite handling or processing of infected animal carcasses or tissues, by ingestion of contaminated water, soil or food, or by inhalation of contaminated dust or aerosols.
the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host. the virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito. after several days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
rarely reported in the americas and europe, sporadic in parts of southeast asia, especially thailand, china, and vietnam. most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. furthermore, in several asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. since s. suis is often misidentified, s. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
human.

o’nyong-nyong virus (onnv), an enveloped rna virus, genus alphavirus in the family togaviridae, closely related to chikungunya virus (chikv, see chikungunya fever map). strains bear the names gulu, igbo-ora, and sg650 viruses.
immunocompromised, asplenic, and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. the number of cases diagnosed in the usa has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population, hosts of the adult vector ticks. nearly all patients with babesia divergens infection in europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. the b. divergens-like parasite in the usa has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits, and is not infectious for cattle; it has been found in only 3 patients. all 3 patients with b. venatorum (eu1) infection had also been splenectomized. cape verdean, egyptian, and asian cases lie outside the range of ixodes ricinus; b. duncani and b. divergens-like cases in west coast states of usa lie outside the range of i. scapularis. possible vectors for these cases are i. dentatus in the central usa, and i. pacificus on the west coast. infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.

epidemic hepatitis, infectious hepatitis, infectious jaundice, catarrhal jaundice.
malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the thai–cambodian border region. uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts); the choice of acts is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an act or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world wide and is generally a disease of poor rural communities. these communities are often in hot and dry regions. it is estimated that there are about 41 million people with active trachoma and 8 million with trichiasis. highest prevalences are found in sub-saharan africa. there is a high burden in ethiopia and sudan, where active trachoma in some communities can be found in > 50% of 1–9-year-old children and trichiasis in > 19% of adults. in asia and central and south america, the distribution ismore focal. overall the incidence of trachoma is declining and the disease has disappeared from europe and north america due to improved living conditions.
for w. bancrofti: culex quinquefasciatus, anopheles spp., and aedes spp. in the pacific islands; for b. malayi: mansonia, anopheles, and aedes; for b. timori, an. barbirostris. anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than culex spp., and culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.
environment (soil) to human. fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs.
drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. there is an up to 10% relapse rate.
the most prevalent htlv-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with atl (immunosuppression) or associated with ham/tsp (immunoactivation). the htlv-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and atl. the htlv-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop htlv-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, sjogren syndrome and ham/tsp.
headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. in the later stage of the disease, the metacestode may grow into neighboring organs (e.g. through the diaphragm into the lungs), and metastases can form anywhere. the differential diagnosis is hepatic cirrhosis or carcinoma. the disease can be fatal.
detection of eggs in feces (eggs resemble those of fasciola hepatica). adult flukes may be seen in the stools or vomit.
not completely understood; most bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals (mainly wild rodents) as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes. african rodents replicate bunv and develop viremia. livestock (goats, sheep, cattle), horses and rodents are hosts for gerv as shown by seroprevalence studies. amplifying hosts for cvv are mainly large mammals (caribou, deer, horses, sheep).
pulmonary distomiasis, lung fluke disease

standard anti-mosquito and anti-malarial precautions. there is no vaccine.
leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ‘daily lives,’ mainly during heavy rainfall. most foci are found in latin america and the caribbean, india, southeast asia, oceania, and eastern europe. the agent favors warm, humid environments. the prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present, local environmental conditions, local occupation, and agricultural practices. protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs, like mining, sewermaintenance, farming, veterinary work, and the military. in the tropics, occupational exposures (rice and sugar cane farming, fishing) and other agricultural activities remain an important risk. leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums, especially during rainy seasons. also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks.
by tick bite; rarely by blood transfusion and transplacental/perinatal. ticks must feed for more than 24 hours for transmission to occur.
mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.

probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in panama and french guiana, also in the usa from a north-bound migratory bird. antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
by mosquito bite. there is no person-toperson transmission.
about 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
for lbrf, borrelia recurrentis, a gram-negative spirochete. for tbrf, at least 15 borrelia species, each specific to a particular species of tick vector. since the 1980s, the number of new borrelia species associated with relapsing fever has increased, in part due to improved diagnostics.
by bite or direct percutaneous contact, mucosal or respiratory exposure to blood, tissues, fluids or lesions of infected animals. in africa, transmission mainly occurs through butchering infected wildlife for food. person-to-person transmission probably occurs through direct contact with infected tissue/fluid, respiratory droplet spread, and indirect via contaminated objects.
the name means ‘joint-breaker’ in the acholi language of africa.
principally humans; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods, other zooplankton. crabs, shrimps, and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells.
oral rehydration therapy (ort) using reduced osmolarity ors; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
giant intestinal fluke infection.
high fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, maculopapular rash beginning on the face, spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet. characteristic small white spots (koplik spots) on the buccal mucosa. complications may consist of otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheal bronchitis (croup), blindness, severe skin infections, severe diarrhea and encephalitis, sometimes fatal. complications are more common and more severe in people with malnutrition, vitamin a deficiency, and chronic diseases. very rarely, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may appear years later.
in the usa, an average of only 6 neuroinvasive cases of eee are reported annually. the annual number of cases has declined in recent years. incidence is similar among different age groups and ethnicities, but it is twice as high among men. persons aged over 50 and under 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease. in north america, outbreaks occur during the mosquito season. in tropical south america transmission to horses is year-round, but human cases are rare. culiseta breeds in swampy areas in woodland, transmitting the virus from marsh-nesting birds to horses kept in such areas; unvaccinated horses often die. outbreaks in mexico and islands of the caribbean have all been due to the north american subtype, indicating spread by migratory birds. south american strains are distinct and of three different lineages, probably determined by the range of different rodent hosts. only a single human case has been reported from brazil, and none from guatemala, belize, colombia, ecuador peru, cuba, or trinidad and tobago in spite of detection of the virus in mosquitoes or horses in those countries. the virus has also been isolated from horses in eastern canada.
dry, sandy alkaline soil in the semi-arid zones of the usa–mexico border and parts of central and south america. in north america, the fungus is mainly found in the lower sonoran life zone with low rainfall and high temperatures c. immitis is present in california, and probably northern mexico and arizona, and c. posadasii is present in the remaining areas.
mosquitoes. the main vector of enzootic veev is the culex (melanoconion) spp. (spissipes group). during veev outbreaks, ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions. epizootic/epidemic subtypes of veev are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera.
salmonella enterica enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi), a gram-negative bacillus. s. typhi belongs to salmonella serogroup d and possesses somatic antigen o9, a single flagellar antigen hd, and virulence antigen vi. s. paratyphi a can cause similar disease.
common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. adults may have constipation, while young children and hiv patients more often have diarrhea. in 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. complications occur in 10–15%, including gi bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy. cfr is approximately 2% (range: common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. adults may have constipation, while young children and hiv patients more often have diarrhea. in 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. complications occur in 10–15%, including gi bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy.
personal anti-mosquito precautions. adulticide spraying is practiced in areas where horse cases appear. a human vaccine against only the north american strain is available for laboratory personnel.
hard ticks (ixodidae). the brown dog tick (rhipicephalus sanguineus), the principal vector of msf, isf, itt, and af, is most active during spring and summer, has a low human affinity, and prefers dogs in a peridomestic environment. the southern african bont tick (amblyomma hebraeum) and a. africanum are the principal vectors of r. africae in southern africa. a. hebraeum is an aggressive, human-biting tick and has high rates of rickettsia infection, and atbf cases therefore often occur in clusters. see key references for further reading on ticks and tick-borne rickettsioses.
sars coronavirus (sars-cov) is a positive-sense, single-stranded, enveloped rna virus of the family coronaviridae. the viral membrane contains a transmembrane (m) glycoprotein, spike (s) glycoprotein, and envelope (e) protein. coronaviruses derive their name from the crown-like (coronalike) morphology on electron microscopy.
although sars-like coronaviruses with very high genetic homology to sars-cov have been identified in masked palm civets, civets are thought to be a non-reservoir, spillover species. horseshoe bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of the progenitor of the sars virus.
especially prevalent in pig-rearing regions of southeast asia, where it is estimated that 10 million people are infected. the disease is most common in lowlands where the snail host is present and it is common practice to fertilize water plants with pig or human feces. disease spread is facilitated by heavy rainfall and extensive flooding, leading to fecal contamination of the water. highest incidence and intensity of infection is found in 10 to14 year old children (no sex difference), probably because they pick and consume water plants when they play. in foci of parasite transmission, the prevalence of infection in children ranges from 57% in mainland china to 25% in taiwan, and from 50% in bangladesh and 60% in india to 10% in thailand. water morning glory (ipomoea aquatica), water caltrop (trapa bicornis), lotus (nymphaea lotus), water cress (neptunia oleracea), and water hyacinth (eichhornia speciosa) are most responsible for human infection, but cysts also float on the surface and may be drunk.
colorado tick fever virus (ctfv), a prototype virus of the genus coltivirus of the family reoviridae; a spherical, enveloped virus with a double-stranded rna genome of 12 segments.
proper cooking, or freezing of fish at 20 c for 7 days destroys the parasite. abandon use of human feces to fertilize fish ponds.
p. ovale initally was thought to be limited to sub-saharan africa, papua new guinea, eastern indonesia, and the philippines. it is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the middle east, the indian subcontinent, and various parts of southeast asia. p. ovale has not yet been reported in south america. in general, p. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in west africa prevalences above 10% are observed. also, infections are most common in children <10 years. there is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, p. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
