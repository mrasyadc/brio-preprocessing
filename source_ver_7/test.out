since the global polio eradication initiative, cases have decreased significantly. there were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries afghanistan, india, nigeria, and pakistan. in endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. in 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in tajikistan. most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in chad, angola, sudan, and the drc.
