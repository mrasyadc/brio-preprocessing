corynebacterium diphtheriae is a gram-positive, aerobic rod that is classified into three potentially toxigenic biotypes, intermedius, mitis, and gravis. toxin producing strains of c. diphtheriae carry a bacteriophage-derived tox gene. toxinproducing strains of c. ulcerans may also cause respiratory diphtheria.
soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. unlike bats, birds are not infected by h. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
domestic and free living ungulates (cattle, sheep, and goats). also found in other livestock, birds, pets (cats and dogs), and ticks. infected animals are generally asymptomatic, but infection may lead to late abortion.

the mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. the infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. o. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
clostridium tetani, a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. the spores can remain viable in the environment for years. c. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by old world hantaviruses; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in newworld cases. symptoms are fever, myalgia, and gi pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock. convalescence is prolonged. cfr is 35–60%.

hard ticks (ixodidae). depending on the tick species, they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia, or via venereal, transovarial, and transstadial passage. animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage. hosts include dogs, rodents, and other animals.
dengue-like acute febrile illness with chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and severe arthralgia of the small joints of the hands and feet, sometimes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, painful lymphadenopathies and often a maculopapular rash. arthralgias may persist for months, but no fatalities have been recorded.
during bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. the amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. in the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.

standard anti-mosquito precautions.
direct person-to-person transmission between close contacts by droplet spread or direct oral contact; through objects contaminated with respiratory secretions.
the true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern brazil and north iran. this is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. in southeast asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. in northeast thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. sporadic human infections with glanders (b. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.

noma is an opportunistic infection with endogenous buccal flora.
tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas, and in warm and wet regions. in the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, mostly in newborn infants. the current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults. in countries with good vaccine coverage in children, adult cases may still be common, as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus. the dtp3 vaccination coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood. the elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79% (153/193) of who member states. however, since c. tetani will always remain present in nature, tetanus will always remain a threat, and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely.
main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
ebola viruses (genus ebolavirus), marburg viruses (genus marburgvirus), and ‘cueva viruses’, family filoviridae, order mononegavirales; enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense rna viruses. there are five ebola viruses: bundibugyo virus (bdbv), ebola virus (ebov), reston virus (restv), sudan virus (sudv), and taï forest virus (tafv); two marburg viruses: marburg virus (marv) and ravn virus (ravv); and one ‘cuevavirus’: lloviu virus (llov).

primary hiv infection is usually a nonspecific illness with fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and a sore throat. generalized lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash may occur. following primary infection there is a prolonged asymptomatic period before the appearance of the clinical manifestations of a loss of immune control over infectious pathogens and cancers. common presenting aids defining illnesses are tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, recurrent bacterial infections, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis, kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, and cmv disease.
none.
the most common clinical presentation for streptobacillosis is a triad of (1) relapsing fever, (2) severe, migratory polyarthralgias, and (3) a peripheral, hemorrhagic maculopapular rash. the most prominent symptom is severe myalgia with prostration. polyarthralgias occur in two-thirds of reported cases. in spirillosis, the bite site becomes indurated and may ulcerate with regional lymphadenopathy; arthritic symptoms are rare. if untreated, the disease may progress to bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis, parotitis, tenosynovitis, and focal abscesses of soft tissues or the brain. cfr in untreated cases may be as much as 13%. there is a significant risk of streptobacillary endocarditis with associated cfr of 50%.
supportive, there is no specific polio treatment.
not completely understood: moist environments close to waterways, in forest or under flooring, also sandy and acidic soil and rotten vegetation. bird excreta have also been implicated as a potential reservoir. dogs are more commonly infected than humans but do not transmit disease.
healthy humans can carry s. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract.
most south and several central american countries between 23 n and 34 s have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions, particularly brazil, colombia, venezuela, and argentina. the prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75% in adults, with active disease developing in approximately 2% of infected individuals. the endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams, mild temperatures, a short winter, and a summer with moderate rain. the disease mainly affects active rural workers (coffee, cotton, and tobacco farmers), probably due to environmental exposure. this explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years. postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form. contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis.
enzyme immunoassay to detect anti hiv antibodies with confirmation by western blot. fourthgeneration hiv serology tests that consist of antibody detection and p24 antigen detection in combination are now commonly used. also rapid tests are available for field testing. viral load and hiv-1 p24 antigen may be used in some circumstances. cd4 cell counts and hiv viral load are used to monitor progression of infection. genotypic and phenotypic tests are used for hivdrug-resistance testing.

community management by safe strategy (see above). the who alliance for the global elimination of trachoma (get 2020) seeks to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
the disease is limited geographically to the range of the vector tick. hyalomma spp. do not occur in the americas and oceania. historically the tick does not appear above 50 n latitude, but possibly due to changes in climate and environment the tick and cchfv outbreaks have occurred above this latitude. in the northern hemisphere, h. marginatum becomes more active by increasing temperatures during spring (april–may) and immature stages are active from may to september. the potential roles of migratory birds and the movement of livestock carrying ticks in the spread of the virus are unclear. cchfv outbreaks mainly occur in those working in agricultural areas. about 90% of the cases in a recent outbreak in turkey were farmers. cases regularly had skin contact with livestock or other animals. also outdoor activities (hiking, camping) in endemic areas are a risk factor. countries on the map marked as having no data (western sahara, palestine, parts of the arabian peninsula, kashmir) are within the range of the vector tick and likely at risk for cchfv outbreaks. cchfv genotypes cluster geographically, with exceptions: the asia 1 genotype has been found in madagascar, where it was possibly introduced by migrating birds, and africa 1 in the middle east, which may have been introduced with infected livestock.
bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular gramnegative bacterium.
brucella melitensis, b. abortus, b. suis, and b. canis, intracellular gram-negative bacilli.
each virus is associated with either one or a few closely related species of rodents, which constitute the virus’s natural reservoir. tacaribe complex viruses in the new world are generally associated with rats and mice (family muridae, subfamily sigmodontinae). the reservoir rodents are chronically infected, and the virus is transmitted among them, leading to lifelong viremia and virus excretion, and they do not die. the reservoir for junin virus is calomys musculinus and c. laucha, for machupo virus, c. callosus, for guanarito virus zygodontomys brevicauda, and for whitewater arroyo virus neotoma albigula. for sabia and chapare viruses the reservoir host is unknown.

deer and dogs (e. chaffeensis, e. ewingii). the whitetailed deer is a complete host for maintaining the transmission cycle of e. chaffeensis. deer, ruminants, and field rodents (a. phagocytophilum); unknown for n. sennetsu; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or elisa; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
globally, there exist four patterns of hav infection, based on age-specific hav seroprevalence rates. high-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children, who are usually asymptomatic. adults are immune and epidemics in these high-endemic areas are uncommon. high-endemic areas is defined as a region where > 90% of the children <10 years are already infected and most cases are asymptomatic. the high endemic areas are generally in poor regions with poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water (see human development index map and sanitation map). improving living conditions leads to intermediate endemicity, which causes high disease rates because more infections now occur in older people (as disease averted in children), who are symptomatic. hav epidemiology in high-endemic areas is shifting to intermediate endemicity, which results in an increase in disease burden. large variations exist within countries in hav incidence. in (very) low-endemic areas, children will not acquire the disease and the adult population will remain susceptible, leading to localized outbreaks. in areas of low endemicity, the overall prevalence is <25%. in developed countries with low endemicity, outbreaks are often caused by contaminated food products, like shellfish, which can concentrate virus, and other food products that are contaminated by an infected food handler.
monkeypox virus (mpv), a double-stranded dna virus of the genus orthopoxvirus, family poxviridae. two clades of monkeypox viruses are known: the west african virus and the congo basin virus. the congo basin strain is more virulent than the west african strain. the mpv genome is > 96% identical to the variola virus genome. however, mpv is not a direct ancestor or descendent of variola virus.
mosquito-host-mosquito. the mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host. depending on ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days.
marine mammals (definitive host), marine invertebrates (intermediate host), and fish (intermediate host). fish are frequently infected: tuna, cod, mackerel, herring, red snapper, pike, sardines, salmon. a. simplex and a. physeteris are parasites of whales, seals, walruses, sea lions, and related mammals. p. decipiens is found in pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walruses). contracaecum spp. are parasites of sea eels and whiting, and have been associated with human anisakiasis.
before 2004, chikv was considered a minor arboviral disease, but since then has spread globally, infecting millions of people. most cases are symptomatic. chikv has been endemic in africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. chikv spread to asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks, similar to dengue fever, involving ae. egypti. the global epidemic started since a mutation in the chikv e1 glycoprotein gene (a226v) occurred, that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by ae. albopictus. the mutated chikv is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where ae. albopictus is present. in 2005–2006 chikv spread from east africa to virgin soil in the indian ocean islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. since 2006, chikv outbreaks with are reported from several (sub)tropical countries in the new world. chikv virus was imported into several european countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern italy. chikv-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous chikv-free areas if ae. albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present.
spherical, enveloped, negative sense rna viruses forming a subgroup of the bunyaviridae family. in the americas, human pathogens belonging to the group are guaroa virus (grov), jamestown canyon virus (jcv), lacrosse virus (lacv), and snowshoe hare virus (sshv). those reported to cause human disease in europe or asia are inkoo virus (inkv), tahyna virus (tahv), and sshv.
rabies can manifest itself in two general forms: classic encephalitic (furious) rabies and paralytic (dumb) rabies. both forms are progressive and generally lead to death. the majority of the cases present as encephalitic rabies, with hydrophobia and hyperexcitability. paralytic rabies presents with flaccid muscle weakness or as febrile encephalopathy. in some papers, a third form, non-classic atypical rabies, is described.
leishmania species, protozoa, members of the trypanosomatidae family, order kinetoplastida. based on development characteristics in the sandfly, leishmania species are classified into the subgenera viannia and leishmania, within which there are various species complexes. leishmania species causing (muco)cutaneous disease in the americas are: l. (viannia) braziliensis (espundia), l. (viannia) colombiensis, l. (leishmania) mexicana (chiclero ulcer), l. (leishmania) pifanoi, l. (viannia) liansoni, l. (leishmania) garnhami, l. (leishmania) amazonensis, l. (viannia) panamensis, l. (viannia) guyanensis (forest yaws), and l. (viannia) peruviana (uta). l. infantum/ chagasi can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. l. chagasi is considered to be the same species as l. infantum, and will be referred to as l. infantum/chagasi.
albendazole or mebendazole.
microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon; membrane filtration; pcr. eosinophilia and high ige levels are indicators of active infection.
hendra virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including urine, saliva, and nasal discharge, or during autopsy of infected horses. nipah virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including bat saliva (on fallen fruit and in date palm sap), or droplets from coughing infected pigs. in bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission.
serology: igm capture elisa on serum or csf; antibodies can be detected in csf after 4 days of disease onset, and in serum after 7 days. virus isolation or viral rna detection by rt-pcr are insensitive.
who estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. the disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. the disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. it is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. african trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. however, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. the chronic gambiense form in west and central africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the great rift valley. uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.
symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder: fever, headache, myalgia, backache, lymphadenopathy (not seen in smallpox), malaise, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body; the lesions eventually crust and fall off. the outcome can be fatal (cfr: 1–10%).
rvfv primarily causes disease in animals in africa and middle east, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. humans that regularly work with animals (farmers, herders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers) are at increased risk of infection. epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams. rvf was initially confined to sub-saharan africa, but appeared in egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the arabian peninsula (saudi arabia and yemen) in 2000 and later also on the comoros islands. as rvfv epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall, outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented.
parasite, kinetoplastida. leishmania donovani and its subspecies donovani and infantum. l. chagasi is considered to be the same species asl.infantum, and are referred to asl.infantum/ chagasi. occasionally, other leishmania spp. can cause visceral disease, usually in immunocompromised individuals.
similar to syphilis, the clinical manifestations can be classified into early and late stages. early-stage lesions are generally infectious and may last up to 5 years, with periods of latency. the disease has a relapsing clinical course with mainly skin manifestations, which is the only finding in pinta. in yaws and endemic syphilis there is also involvement of the mucous membranes and the bones. cardiovascular and neurological lesions are extremely rare.
humans
eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). the copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. the larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. the larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.
lice infestation (pediculosis) can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling (bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation). the body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding. oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people.
uncomplicated malaria: acute febrile illness with headache, chills, sweats, nausea, and vomiting; hepatosplenomegaly. findings of severe malaria can be: cerebral malaria (confusion, seizures, impaired consciousness to coma), hemolysis, severe anemia, hypotension, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and death. often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria ( > 5% infected erythrocytes).
praziquantel and niclosamide are the drugs of choice. in untreated cases the worms can live up to 25 years and produce eggs.
early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). proper bodily hygiene.
several serologic tests are available. virus can be isolated or rna detected in acute blood by rt-pcr.
depends on portal of entry. the skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. gi anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. untreated cutaneous anthrax has a cfr of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), gi anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. there they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. when the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. in some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
the diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features. the bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis.
rabies virus, a rhabdovirus of the genus lyssavirus, with a nonsegmented, negative-stranded rna genome. at least 11 different genotypes exist, with genotype 1, rabies virus (rabv) causing classic rabies world wide. genotypes 2–11 have a more limited host-range and geographic distribution: lagos bat virus (lbv), mokola virus (mokv), duvenhage virus (duvv), european bat lyssa virus 1 and 2 (eblv-1/2), australian bat lyssa virus (ablv), aravan virus (arav), irkut virus (irkv), khujand virus (khuv), and west caucasian bat virus (wcbv).
depends on disease severity and type of disease. in areas with high penicillin resistance, ceftriaxone can be used for severe disease. in case of ceftriaxone resistance, vancomycin is used. for meningitis, dexamethasone is added to antibiotic treatment.

world wide, but close to elimination in the americas and targeted for elimination in europe by 2015. in the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. crs is also grossly underreported. for example, it is estimated that over 45,000 crs cases occur annually in southeast asia yet only an average of 13 crs cases per year were reported to who between 2000 and 2009. rubella is a public health concern because of crs and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 crs cases occurred annually in developing countries. paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of crs if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. in 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of crs, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in crs cases.
viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding, then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days, the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding.
wnv was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the west nile district of uganda in 1937. molecular studies suggest that wnv emerged in africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. until the introduction of wnv in new york in 1999, wnv infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. since the introduction to northeast america, the virus has spread to most regions in north america, canada, mexico, the caribbean and several cases in south america. the national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the usa during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). in that time period in the usa, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. the highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin thewest central and mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic wnv vector in those areas. most us cases occur in the late summer, when culex mosquitoes are more active and after wnv amplification in the bird reservoir. in warm climates year-round transmission is seen.
microscopy of stool specimens cannot distinguish between e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii, and e. dispar; pcr is able to distinguish between these species; stool antigen tests can identify e. histolytica. 
sudden onset of high fever (biphasic), chills, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, ocular pain, conjunctivitis, anorexia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. spleen and liver can be palpable, and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found. a few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash. prolonged convalescence may follow. children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations, including a more pronounced rash, dic, and gi bleeding; or cns involvement including meningitis and encephalitis. fatalities are rare.

not completely understood. possibly in the soil the fungus produces infective propagula that can become airborne, inhaled, and lead to respiratory infection. infections may also occur through traumatic lesions, but this has not been demonstrated.
lassa fever virus (lfv), a spherical, enveloped, bisegmented negative strand rna virus of the genus arenavirus in the family arenaviridae.
by bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly.
mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. there is an enzootic cycle, mainly between c. taralsis and passerine birds. there is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. humans and horses are dead-end hosts for weev because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
anti-mosquito measures: light-colored clothing with long sleeves mosquito repellents containing deet on exposed skin, avoid as much as possible outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active, and removal of mosquito-breeding sites from around the home.
infective sporozoites are inoculated by the bite of anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites, or to a dormant stage (hypnozoite) that can become active after months or years, causing relapse. merozoites released from liver infect erythrocytes that develop to schizonts, rupture and release merozoites that will infect new erythrocytes (this cycle takes 48 hours). some merozoites develop into gametocytes that are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal.
by tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.

bilharziasis, katayama fever or syndrome, urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis.
zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the old world and is absent from the americas (a single case in the usa was imported from yap island). the competence of mosquitoes on the american continent for zika virus is unknown. the geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases, mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys. positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive, because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses. in 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73% of the population of yap island. there were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak. due to intense air travel in the pacific region and presence of competent vectors, there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond. adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years. approximately 18% of individuals infected by the zika virus develop symptoms; this is similar to that reported for west nile virus infection.
infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound. the tabanid bite is painful with blood loss.
the tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. as the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
humans are the main reservoir. s. haematobium can infect primates, livestock and rodents. s. mansoni, s. intercalatum, and s. guineensis can infect rodents.

loiasis occurs in areas where the chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of central africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. the prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. it has been proposed that areas where the loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan, with a flagellate form in the bloodstream and an intracellular form without flagellum.
ticks introduce babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. the sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. the gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
anthrax has a worldwide distribution. livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.there is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. gi anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the usa in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.

tb is a major cause of death and disability world wide, especially in developing countries. morbidity and mortality rates increase with age, and are higher in males. in regions of high incidence, morbidity peaks in adults of working age. morbidity is higher in urban populations, among the poor, and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks. there were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of tb in the world in 2007 (14% hiv positive), an almost 50% increase from 1990, and an estimated onethird of the world’s population is either latently or actively infected with tb. most of the cases in 2007 were in asia (55%) and africa (31%). mdr-tb is a serious problem in russia, former russian republics, india and china. in 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million mdr-tb cases. by 2008, 55 countries reported at least one xdr-tb case.
the highest global burden of cl is in the old world. in the americas, bolivia, brazil, and peru have the highest burden of cl. in the new world, cl mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the old world it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. transmision can also occur in deforested areas. disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
