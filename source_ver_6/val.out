cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. sporadic human infections with glanders (b. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
the true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern brazil and north iran. this is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. in southeast asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water.
